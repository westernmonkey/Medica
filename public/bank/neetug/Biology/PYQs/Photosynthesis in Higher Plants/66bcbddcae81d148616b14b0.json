Rubisco fixes oxygen about 20 percent of the time, initiating a process called photorespiration that recycles the toxic compound. Photorespiration costs the plant energy it could have used to photosynthesize.\n(ii) When stomata are open to let carbon dioxide in, they also let water vapor out, leaving $\\mathrm{C}_3$ plants at a disadvantage in drought and high-temperature environments.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ26012528", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "updatedAt": "2024-08-28T16:33:11.673Z", "updated_by": "65d0c176a8f74604505ba6f6", "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a44946f4e4a198e5b3", "616025a562fb272c4efefe85", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef185", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f659", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1b", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda66"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
