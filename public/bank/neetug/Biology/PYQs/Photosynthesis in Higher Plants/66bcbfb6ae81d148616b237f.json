NADH and NADPH are the reduced forms of NAD and NADP, respectively. Though NADH and NADPH are structurally more similar, they differ by their role in the cell. The main difference between NADH and NADPH is that NADH is used in cellular respiration, whereas NADPH is used in photosynthesis. NADH is produced in the glycolysis and Krebs cycle and is used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">NADPH is produced in the light reaction of photosynthesis and is used in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide.
