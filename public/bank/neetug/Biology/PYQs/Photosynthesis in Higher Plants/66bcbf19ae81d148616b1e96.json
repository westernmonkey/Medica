The vascular bundles are surrounded by several layers of specialized large sized cells called bundle sheath cells. The $\\mathrm{C}_4$ cycle involves two carboxylation reactions, one taking place in chloroplasts of mesophyll cells and another in chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells.\nIn $\\mathrm{C}_4$ plants, the first step of carbon dioxide fixation takes place in the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells containing PEP, while bundle sheath cells contain RuBisCO.\nRelated Theory\nThe $C_4$ plants consume more energy (i.e., two additional molecules of ATP) during the fixation of carbon dioxide. The mesophyll cells of the $C_4$ plants are closely packed which provide smaller area for better utilization of the available water. This also reduces the intensity of solar radiations. This makes the $C_4$ plants better adapted to the conditions of tropical climate. They do not show photorespiration. Thus, their photosynthetic rate is quite high.\nCaution\nBundle sheath cells are absent in $\\mathrm{C}_3$ plants.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ92976344", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a44946f4e4a198e5b3", "616025a562fb272c4efefe85", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef185", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f659", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1b", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda66"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
