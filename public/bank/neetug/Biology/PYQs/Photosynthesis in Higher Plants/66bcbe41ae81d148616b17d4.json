In the leaves of $\\mathrm{C}_4$-plants, the vascular bundles are surrounded by bundle sheath of parenchymatous cells, which in turn are surrounded by mesophyll cells. Chloroplasts in bundle sheath cells are larger and always contain grana whereas chloroplasts in mesophyll cells are smaller. The $\\mathrm{C}_4$-plants are photosynthetically more efficient than $\\mathrm{C}_3$-plants because they have more chloroplasts.\nPhotorespiration takes place only in $\\mathrm{C}_3$-plants. It occurs in chlorophyllous t\u00edssue. At high temperature and high oxygen concentration the affinity of RuBP carboxylase for $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ decrease and for $\\mathrm{O}_2$ increases.\nPhotosynthesis takes $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ and release $\\mathrm{O}_2$, while respiration utilizes $\\mathrm{O}_2$ and release $\\mathrm{CO}_2$. If the light factor is saturating, there will be certain concentration of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ in the atmosphere at which the rate of photosynthesis will be equal to rate of respiration. This is called carbon dioxide compensation point. $\\mathrm{C}_4$-plants have very low $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ compensation point", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ23190175", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a44946f4e4a198e5b3", "616025a562fb272c4efefe85", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef185", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f659", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1b", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda66"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
