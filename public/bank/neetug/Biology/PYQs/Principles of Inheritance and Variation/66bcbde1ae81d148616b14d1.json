Since males have one $\\mathrm{X}$ and one $\\mathrm{Y}$ chromosome, and the genes present on $\\mathrm{X}$ don't have counter genes on $\\mathrm{Y}$, only one affected gene (to be present on $\\mathrm{X}$ ) is required for the disease in males. While in females, there are $2 \\mathrm{X}$ chromosomes. For the disease to occur both the $\\mathrm{X}$ chromosomes should have the affected genes which is a rare chance. For this to be possible, the father of the female must be diseased while the mother must atleast be a carrier.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ88675764", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
