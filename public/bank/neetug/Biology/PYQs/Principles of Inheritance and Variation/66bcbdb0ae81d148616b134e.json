As under laboratory conditions, N. tabacum and $\\mathrm{N}$. sylvestris cannot produce selffertile offspring, so they are not reproductively isolated. They are considered as separate species because since their flowering periods are different so cross pollination is not possible between them naturally. This makes them different species.\nCaution\nStudents are generally intimidated by such long questions. However, in most cases. such type of questions are framed to test the presence of mind and witty nature. These questions are easy to answer and the actual question is asked in last 2 lines only, rest form the story around it. As in this case, 'What is the best reason for considering $N$. sylvestris and $N$. tabacum to be separate species' is the question in focus and the options given defines the universal term 'species.'", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ43594665", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
