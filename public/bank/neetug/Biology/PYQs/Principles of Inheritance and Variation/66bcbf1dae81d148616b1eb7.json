A family tree can be represented by a pedigrec chart with all the members of a family. They may be having a genetic disorder or may be carrier of the disease. In the pedigree analysis, standard symbols are used to distinguish between different family. It helps to understand whether the trait is dominant or recessive, sex linked or autosomal. It helps to trace the inheritance of a specific trait in a family.\nRelated Theory\nAny changes in DNA sequence, e.g., mistakes during DNA replication may lead to a change in the genetic codes or chromosomal aberrations. Inheritance of altered genes causes genetic disorders in offspring. Ther genetic inheritance is governed by Mendelian genetics. Mendelian disorders mostly occur in families with a certain pattern reflecting the alteration in a single gene. Prediction of these disorders is based on family history and can be done with the help of a family tree. This process of analysis of a number of generations of a family is called the pedigree analysis. Pedigree analysis is a strong tool in human genetics which helps to predict the pattern of inheritance, even when data is limited.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ32021905", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
