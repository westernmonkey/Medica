However, father sperm consist only nucleus. Thus, the cytoplasmic inheritance is also called maternal inheritance. Genes located on Y-chromosome show Y-linked inheritance. This carries the paternal influences. A gene located in the X-chromosome shows $\\mathrm{X}$-linked inheritance. In this, a male transmits his X-chromosome only to his daughters while a female transmits one of her X-chromosomes to the offspring of both sexes. Autosomes are contributed by both of the parents.\nRelated Theory\nThe female reproductive cell or the egg has a large amount of cytoplasm containing many organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria which contain their own genes and can reproduce independently. Because these organelles are contributed by the female, cytoplasmic inheritance occurs in the maternal line.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ52210455", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
