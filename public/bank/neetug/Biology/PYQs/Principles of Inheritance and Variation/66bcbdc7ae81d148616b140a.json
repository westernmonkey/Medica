The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions.\nTransition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine.\nTransversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine.\nA frameshift mutation occurs due to an insertion or deletion of a base pair that are usually not in the multiples of three. It causes the transformation of the genetic code in an unreadable format or a reading frame from the location of the mutation up till the end of the gene.\nRelated Theory\nOnce a pollen grain lands on the stigma of a flower of its same species, it sends out a\nTranscription is not a mutation, but a gene regulation mechanism in which DNA forms RNA.\nRelated Theory\nPoint (substitution) mutations can either be of three types:\n<img src=\"https://cdn-question-pool.getmarks.app/pyq/neet/Y_PU3DbA4j6At1uyBldCKTT_XL3ZBGz3yI3ab6VTocc.original.fullsize.png\"><br>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ05669046", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
