This defect is due to mutation in certain genes present in the X chromosome. It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and only about 0.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to red-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome and females have two.</p><p>A man whose father was colour blind (X<sup>C</sup>Y) has a zero per cent chance of being colour blind. a woman who had a colour blind mother (X<sup>C</sup>X<sup>C</sup>) and normal father (XY) is not herself colour blind because the gene is recessive.
