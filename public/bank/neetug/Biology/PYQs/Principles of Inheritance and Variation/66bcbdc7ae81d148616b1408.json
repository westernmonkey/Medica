In mammals, cytoplasmic genes are only contributed by female gamete, e.g., Male gamete only contribute its nuclear genes. Thus, none progenies would not inherit any mutated genes in mitochondria by father.\nRelated Theory\nThe phenotypes that are controlled by nuclear factors found in the cytoplasm of the female are said to express a maternal effect. Those phenotypes controlled by organelle genes exhibit maternal inheritance. The classic phenotype which exhibits maternal effects is coiling direction of snail shells.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ34303173", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
