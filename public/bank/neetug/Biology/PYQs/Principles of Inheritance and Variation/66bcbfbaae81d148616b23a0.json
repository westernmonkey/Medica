The checkerboard was devised by a British geneticist, Reginald Punnett (1927). It depicts both genotypes and phenotypes of the progeny.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Genetic linkage is the tendency of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. The term &quot;linkage&quot; was coined by T.H. Morgan. Franklin Stahl with Matthew Meselson proved the semi-conservative replication of DNA. Spliceosomes are formed during post-transcriptional changes in eukaryotes. It is a complex, formed between 5&#39; end (GU) and 3&#39; end (AG) of the intron to remove it.<br />Transduction is a method of sexual reproduction in bacteria. It involves the transfer of foreign genes by means of viruses. It was discovered by Zinder and his researcher Lederberg (1952) in <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em>.</p>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ25812679", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
