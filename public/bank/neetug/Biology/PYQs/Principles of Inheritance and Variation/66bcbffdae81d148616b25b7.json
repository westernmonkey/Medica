The two workers found a close similarity between the transmission of hereditary traits and behavior of chromosomes while passing from generation to the next through the agency of gametes. <strong>Sutton</strong> united the knowledge of chromosomal segregation with Mendelian principles and called it the chromosomal theory of inheritance.&nbsp;Following the synthesis of ideas, experimental verification of the chromosomal theory of inheritance by<strong> Thomas Hunt Morgan</strong> and his colleagues led to the discovery&nbsp;of the basis for the variations that sexual reproduction produced. Morgan worked with the tiny fruit flies,&nbsp;which were found very suitable for such studies.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "ques_type": "Single correct", "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ10505262", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
