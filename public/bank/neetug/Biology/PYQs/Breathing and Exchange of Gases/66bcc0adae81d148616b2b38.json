About 7 percent of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.\nThe binding of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ with haemoglobin is related to the partial pressure of $\\mathrm{CO}_2 . \\mathrm{pO}_2$ is a major factor which could affect this binding. When $\\mathrm{pCO}_2$ is high and $\\mathrm{pO}_2$ is low as in the tissues, more binding of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ occurs. Percentage of a gas transported depends upon its partial pressure. If partial pressure decreases, the transportation of gases also decrease with haemoglobin.
