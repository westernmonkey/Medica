The external layer is composed of a dense connective tissue and is called the sclera. The middle layer, Choroid, contains many blood vessels and looks bluish in colour. The choroid layer is thin over the posterior $2 / 3$ of the eye ball and becomes thick in the anterior part to form the ciliary body.
