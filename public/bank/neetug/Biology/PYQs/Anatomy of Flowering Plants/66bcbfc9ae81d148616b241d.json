In temperate climates, the cambium is more active giving rise to a higher number of vessels with greater activities, while in winter, it becomes less active and forms narrower and smaller vessels. Both spring and autumn wood contribute for an annual ring, forming one ring a year. Annual rings are prominent in trees of temperate region.&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "ques_type": "Incorrect Statement", "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ64181105", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
