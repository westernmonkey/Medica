The cells of this wood are filled with resins or tannins produced by adjacent functional cells. The activities of vessels become blocked by tyloses. Due to these activities, non-functional, secondary xylem becomes hard, durable and blackish in colour, called heart-wood. Now, the function of secondary xylem (water and mineral conduction from roots) is performed by outer younger-rings of xylem, which is called sap wood.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ72312447", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
