Some of the free nuclei act as eggs as there is no archegonium.\nThe short apices in Gnetum and angiosperms show a distinct tunica and corpus configuration.\nThe cortex of stem of Pinus is traversed by large resin ducts or canals. Each duct or canal is lined by a layer of thin-walled parenchymatous glandular secretory cells constituting epithelium. The epithelial cells secrete resin into canal.
