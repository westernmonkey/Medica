The microsporophylls are compactly arranged in male cones or male strobili. In a microsporangium there are special diploid cells called microspores mother cells&nbsp;which undergo meiosis or reduction division to produce haploid microspores.&nbsp;Within the microspore, a reduced few celled male gametophyte generation develops. This entire structure is in the pollen grain which develops within the microsporangia.&nbsp;The megaspores are produced in megasporangia or ovules which are produced by modified fertile leaves called megasporophylls.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "ques_type": "Incorrect statement", "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ86079197", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
