The two steroid hormones produced by ovary are oestrogen and progesterone. Oestrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth and activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing ovarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., high pitch of voice, etc.) mammary gland development. Oestrogens also regulate female sexual behaviour.\nAlpha cells of islets of Langerhans of the endocrine pancreas secrete a hormone called glucagon. It is a peptide hormone and plays an important role in maintaining the normal blood glucose levels. It acts mainly on the liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia). In addition, this hormone stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to hyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and utilization. Thus, glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone.\nThe pars distalis region of pituitary, commony called produced anterior pituitary, Growth Hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH), Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Over secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of $\\mathrm{GH}$ results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarfism.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ22312871", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a79fd0ba00a6729b37", "616025a8d94f353fd75bfbbc", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef171", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fd", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b699e", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda62"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
