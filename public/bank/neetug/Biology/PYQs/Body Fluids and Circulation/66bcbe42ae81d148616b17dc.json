Monocytes are largest of all leucocytes and generally change into macrophages after entering tissue spaces. Neutrophils are most numerous of all leucocytes, and have many lobed nucleus.\nEosinophils are granular white blood cells. Their number increases in people with allergic conditions such as asthma or hay fever. They are non-phagocytic and seem to play part in immune system\nLymphocytes are non-motile and non-phagocytic in nature. They produce antibodies to destroy microbes. These are found as B and T-lymphocytes.
