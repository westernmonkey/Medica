Eosinophils and monocytes make 2-4% and 3-8% of the total WBCs respectively.</p><p>Eosinophils also called acidophils have a bilobed nucleus, Basophils have two or three lobed S shaped nucleus, Kidney shaped nucleus or Bean shaped nucleus is present in Monocytes.&nbsp;</p><p>Basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils are granulocytes.
