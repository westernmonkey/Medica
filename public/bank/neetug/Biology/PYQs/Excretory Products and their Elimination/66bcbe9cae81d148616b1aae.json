In liver, one molecule of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ is activated by biotin and combines with two molecules of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ in the presence of carbamyl phosphate synthetase enzyme and 2ATP to form carbamyl phosphate and one molecule of $\\mathrm{H}_2 \\mathrm{O}$ is released. Carbamyl phosphate reacts with ornithine and forms citrulline.
