This also increases the volume of blood followed by an i<strong>ncrease in glomerular blood pressure and GFR.</strong><br />d.&nbsp;It stimulates neurohypophysis to release <strong>ADH which in turn increases reabsorption of water through kidney tubules causing an&nbsp;increase in the volume of blood.</strong></p><p>The <strong>atrial natriuretic peptide/factor</strong> is secreted by the cells of the&nbsp;atria of the heart. The secretion of ANP is induced by increased stretching of atrial chambers by the increased volume of blood. It enhances the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys. <strong>ANP inhibits the release of ADH, aldosterone, and rennin.
