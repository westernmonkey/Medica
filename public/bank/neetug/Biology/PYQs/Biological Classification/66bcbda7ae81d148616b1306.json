When the environment is again suitable, the envelope ruptures and the Amoeba emerges.\nRelated Theory\nDuring unfavourable conditions, Amoeba undergo multiple fission inside the cyst to survive and reproduce under unfavourable conditions. In the multiplefission, the nucleus of the parent cell divides multiple times by amitosis (direct cell division), producing several nuclei. The cytoplasm, later on, separates, creating multiple daughter cells. When the conditions are unfavourable, Amoeba withdraws its pseudopodia and becomes almost round.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ74268600", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
