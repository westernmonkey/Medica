They are formed from thread-like hyphae that spread out from a visible mycelium. It causes mucormycosis. Most people develop this infection by breathing in mould spores. Less often, infection can develop when spores enter the body through a cut or open wound. It was much prevalent during second wave of COVID-19 (as black fungus) in 2021 in India.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ50438510", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
