It is also known as super bug and was discovered by Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty. Cyclosporin is obtained from Trichoderma polysporum which is used as immunosuppressive agent. Xanthomonas is a disease causing gram negative bacteria.\nRelated Theory\nBioremediation is a biotechnical process which involves the removal of complex material or contamination by degrading environmental pollutants using living microorganisms. The ability of micro-organisms could be enhanced by providing optimum growth conditions to micro-organism or by employing the genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs). This technology has been implemented to eradicate environmentally hazardous chemicals and detoxify them into nontoxic forms.\nCaution\nBioaugmentation involves the injection of a small amount of oil-degrading microbes into an affected area. Biostimulation is the addition of nutrients to stimulate the growth of innate oil-degrading microbes to increase the rate of remediation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ75087650", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
