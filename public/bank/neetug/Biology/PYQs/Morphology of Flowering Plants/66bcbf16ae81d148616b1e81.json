A flower is present terminally on the main axis. The flowers are borne in a basipetal order. The main axis has limited growth. The growth of the main axis is limited and the lateral axis also terminates into flower and that limits the growth of the axis. Flowers are present in the basipetal succession, i.e. older flower is present terminally and the younger ones at the base. This type of arrangement is known as centrifugal with the older flowers present in the middle and the younger ones at the periphery. In racemose types of inflorescence, the main axis grows continuously and flowers are present laterally on the floral axis. Flowers are present in an acropetal manner.\n<img src=\"https://cdn-question-pool.getmarks.app/pyq/neet/lF9LGMcB-LzwgUQ-SUjxyCzBoU2sbjyUVfYvwmJpaVg.original.fullsize.png\"><br>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ92672459", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025836a44c4d339a09c6a", "616025856b27bf5d90dc8ac8", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef146", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f623", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a15", "68091fc53a10446a207fdabb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
