All monosaccharides are reducing sugars, along with some disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. The monosaccharides can be divided into two groups: the aldoses, which have an aldehyde group, and the ketoses, which have a ketone group. Ketoses must first tautomerize to aldoses before they can act as reducing sugars. The common dietary monosaccharides&nbsp;are galactose, glucose and fructose are all reducing sugars. Sucrose is a disaccharide. It is composed of each one of the glucose and fructose molecules joined together by <math><mi>&#945;</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1,2</mn></math> glycosidic bond.
