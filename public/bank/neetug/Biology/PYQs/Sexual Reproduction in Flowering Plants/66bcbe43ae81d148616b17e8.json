Through meiosis it gives rise to four megaspores (haploid). In most plants only one of these megaspores survive. This functional megaspore divides three times by mitosis and produces eight haploid nuclei enclosed within a 7-celled embryo sac. One nucleus is located near the opening of embryo sac in egg cell. Two nuclei are located in a single cell in the midde of embryo sac and are called polar nuclei, two nuclei are contained in cells called synergids that flank the egg cell and other three nuclei are resided in the cells called antipodals, located at the end of embryo sac, opposite the egg cell.\nNucellus is centrally located mass of thin-walled parenchymatous cells covered by integuments in ovule.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ36160397", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c322cc696a9491eb44", "616025c2822b7bb5e27982e5", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24a", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f626", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a22", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
