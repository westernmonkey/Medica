The ejected tissues collapse and are digested by bacteria. Rapid spread of bacterial infection occurs through vascular strand. The stems and leaves of infected plant give blighted or burnt up appearance. Control measures include rogueing; 3-year crop rotation, disease free seeds, spray of copper fungicides and antibiotics besides showing disease resistant varieties.\nBordeaux mixture is most common fungicide. It was first discovered by Millardet in 1882 at university of Bordeaux France to control downy mildew of grapes. It is prepared by mixing copper sulphate, lime and water in the ratio of $4: 4: 50$.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ59078136", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
