They also occur in the epithelial cells of intestine, fat bodies, Malpighian tubules etc. They begin as normal chromosomes, but through repeated rounds of DNA replication without any cell division (called endoreplication/endomitosis), they become large, having a high content of DNA.\nRelated Theory\nIn some developmental stages, one or more bands bear conspicuous swellings called chromosome puffs or bulbs. The larger swellings are known as Balbiani rings. These puffs are made up of a core of DNA surrounded by a matrix of RNA. These regions contain actively transcribing DNA and are involved in the synthesis of different RNA types. The process of puffing is related to gene expression.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ43969325", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
