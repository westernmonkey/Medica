A simple food chain consists of producers, herbivores and carnivores. The length of food chain is generally limited to 3-4 trophic levels due to energy loss. In grazing food chain the producers (ie, plants) are eaten by herbivores (ie, rabbit, deer, cow etc) and the herbivores are eaten by carnivores.
