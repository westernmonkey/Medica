Since the Moon has no atmosphere, it experiences extreme temperatures. During the day time, the temperature may be as high as $127^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and it can drop down to $-173^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Further, due to the absence of atmosphere, there is no weather, wind, clouds, rain and water on the Moon.\nRelated Theory:-\nAfter the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system soil contains water to extract and temperature range is not too extreme. There is enough sunlight and Gravity 38% that of our Earth's. It has an atmosphere that offers protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation. Also, the day/night rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth i.e., 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ80774350", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "updatedAt": "2024-08-29T14:24:53.673Z", "updated_by": "65d0c176a8f74604505ba6f6", "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
