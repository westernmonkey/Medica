This does happen between populations of a species, and tends to reduce the differences between populations. Gene flow occurs between populations of a species by gene migration i.e., emigration and immigration. This is because gene flow ensures that all the populations of a particular species share a common gene pool. Variations too, exist between members of a particular species.\nRelated Theory\nIn biology, species is the most basic unit of classification, as well as a taxonomic rank. The next taxonomic rank on the hierarchy of biological classification is a genus. Species is the lowest taxon in the taxonomical hierarchy. The members of a particular species can interbreed, but are reproductively isolated from members of other species.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ54893461", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
