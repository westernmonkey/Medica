Due to nutrient enrichment, excess growth of algae occurs which is called algal bloom. When these algae die, their organic matter gets decomposed and this results in the depletion of oxygen leading to death of aquatic animals. Hence, this indicates that lot of urea and phosphate fertilizers are were used in nearby crops.
