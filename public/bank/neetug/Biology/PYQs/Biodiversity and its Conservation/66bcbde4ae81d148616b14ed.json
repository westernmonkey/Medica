The harvested wood is first processed so that the fibres are separated from the unusable fraction of the wood, the lignin.\nRelated Theory\nThe pulping process is aimed at removing lignin without loosed fibre strength, thereby freeing the fibres and removing impurities that cause discoloration and possible future disintegration of the paper. Hemicellulose plays an important role in fibre-to-fibre bonding in papermaking. Several extractives such as waxes, resins are contained in wood but they do not contribute to its strength properties; these too are removed during the pulping process. In general, the softwoods (e.g., pines, firs, and spruces) yield long and strong fibres and hardwoods produce $a$ weaker paper as they contain shorter fibres.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ27163215", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
