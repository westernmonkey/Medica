The hot spots are richest and the most threatened reservoirs of plant and animal life on earth. The key criteria for determining a hot spot are:<br />1) Very high levels of species richness.<br />2) High degree of endemism (species confined to that region and not found anywhere else).<br />3)Degree of threat, which is measured in terms of habitat loss.<br />Initially 25 hot spots were identified globally. But now the number is raised to 34 with earth&rsquo;s land area of less than 2%. The number of species they collectively harbor is extremely high and strict protection of these hot spots could reduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 %.&nbsp;<br />India has three hotspots &ndash;&nbsp;<br />1. Western Ghats and Sri Lanka&nbsp;<br />2. Indo&ndash;Burma and&nbsp;<br />3. Himalaya, and these extend into the neighbouring countries also.</p></blockquote>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ70751738", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
