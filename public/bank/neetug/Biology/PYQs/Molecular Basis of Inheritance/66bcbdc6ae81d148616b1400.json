Determining and analysing the repeated sequences (as in STR), form the basis of DNA fingerprinting.\nRelated Theory\nSir Alec Jeffreys is the father of DNA fingerprinting. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) represents the blueprint of the human genetic makeup. A DNA fingerprint, therefore, is a DNA pattern that has a unique sequence such that it can be distinguished from the DNA patterns of other individuals. DNA fingerprinting is also called DNA typing.\nCaution\nEarlier, VNTRs (Variable Number Tandem Repeats) sequence were analysed during the process. However, with advancement of technology, STRs (Short Tandem Repeats) are studied present, which provide better results than VNTR.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ72748299", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
