Transcription factor is the molecular basis of organ differentiation.\nRelated Theory\nThe fate of a cell describes what it will become in the course of normal development. The fate of a particular cell can be discovered by labelling that cell and observing what structures it becomes a part of. The developmental potential, or potency, of a cell describes the range of different cell types it can become. The zygote and its very early descendants are totipotent - these cells have the potential to develop into a complete organism. The determination of different cell types (cell fates) involves progressive restrictions in their developmental potentials. Differentiation follows determination, as the cell elaborates a cell-specific developmental program. Differentiation results in the presence of cell types that have clear-cut identities, such as muscle cells, nerve cells, and skin cells.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ51445469", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
