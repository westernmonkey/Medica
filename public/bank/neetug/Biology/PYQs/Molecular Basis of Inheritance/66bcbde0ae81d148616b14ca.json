This protein is an enzyme that is capable of breaking down the lactose into simpler sugars which can be absorbed by the bacteria. Hence a mutated $z$ gene would result in a non-functional enzyme and thus the bacteria cannot grow.\nRelated Theory\nGlucose is the preferred and most frequently available energy source for E. coli. The enzymes to metabolize glucose are made constantly by E. coli. When E. coli is exposed to both lactose and glucose, the organism first metabolise glucose and then temporarily cease to grow until the genes of lac operon become included to provide the ability to metabolise lactose.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ46462483", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
