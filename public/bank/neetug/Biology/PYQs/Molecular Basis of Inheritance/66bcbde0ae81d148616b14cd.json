Ribosomes are found in the cytosol and in the semi-autonomous organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.\nRelated Theory\nRibosomes either occur singly (monosomes) or in cluster (polysomes). Apart from ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the other two forms of RNA required for protein synthesis are: messenger $R N A$ (mRNA), which carries coding information from DNA, and transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries amino acids. Ribosomes use the information in $m R N A$ to direct the synthesis of a protein. In prokaryotes, during proteins synthesis, many ribosomes line up and join the $m R N A$ to form a string of ribosomes called polyribosome or polysome.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ38129298", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
