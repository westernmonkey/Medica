The intraspecific competition may be very severe becauseall the members of a species have similar requirements of food, habitat mate, etc and they also have similar adaptations to gettheir needs. An interaction between individuals of different species wherein both are negatively affected is interspecific competition. An interaction between two species wherein both species involved are benefited is Mutualism. Predation is the act of preying on other animals is termed predation. The animal which hunts and kills other animals for food, is called the predator and the attacked animal is called the prey.\nRelated Theory\nThe principle of competitive exclusion was proposed by Gause states that two species competing for the same resources cannot coexist. One population will drive off the other one. If any of the members of the depleted population remains, that would be because they have adapted themselves according to the different niche.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ65507256", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "updatedAt": "2024-08-28T16:52:43.505Z", "updated_by": "65d0c176a8f74604505ba6f6", "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
