Social insects are the ants, bees, wasps, and termites that have organized societies and live in colonies. They have one or a few females responsible for all the egg laying, while other members of the colony (usually sterile females) gather food and do other tasks. Camouflage or cryptic colouration is a defence mechanism that helps insects merge with their surroundings. They do it to conceal their presence or identity, either to hoodwink their predators or to deceive their prey. M\u00fcllerian mimicry is a form of biological resemblance in which two or more unrelated noxious, or dangerous, organisms and exhibit closely similar warning systems, such as the same pattern of bright colours. Warning colouration (or aposematism) is how animals let other animals know that they are poisonous or dangerous.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ59741502", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "updatedAt": "2024-08-28T16:45:32.524Z", "updated_by": "65d0c176a8f74604505ba6f6", "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
