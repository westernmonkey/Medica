As a defence mechanism puffers have the ability to inflate rapidly, filling their extremely elastic stomach with water (or air) until they are almost spherical. This prevents them from being identified by the predator. But poison fangs in snakes are a method adopted for preying and not escaping predation.\nRelated Theory\nPrey species have defense adaptations that help them escape predation. These defenses may be mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioural. Camouflage is the ability of an organism to blend in with its surroundings.\nIt can be as simple as being the predominant colour of surrounding vegetation, or it can define an organism's complete morphology, like this walking stick. It is considered as a great defensive strategy, as evidenced by its widespread use in nature.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ91217359", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
