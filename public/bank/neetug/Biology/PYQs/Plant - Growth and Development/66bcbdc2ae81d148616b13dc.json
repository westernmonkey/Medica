If these plants are exposed to day lengths in excess of this critical point, they continue growing vegetatively and do not show flowering. Most of the winter flowering plants belong to this category. For example, Rice, coffee, soybean, tobacco, sugarcane, strawberry and chrysanthemum.\nRelated Theory\nIn long that plants, it was found that they can flower even under short day conditions, if a flash of light is provided to the plant during the long dark period.
