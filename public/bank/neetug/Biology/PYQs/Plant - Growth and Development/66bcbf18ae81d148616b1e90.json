Disease free plants can be produced in large number.\nRelated Theory\nIn Tissue culture, culture of an excised part in an aseptic culture medium to form a callus, in which differentiation of root and shoot buds is induced by providing suitable combination of auxins and cytokinin then the plantlets are transferred to the soil to develop into mature plants. The technique is based on the property of totipotency of plant cell which means that any cell from any part of the plant can be used to generate a whole new plant.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ51161065", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
