During germination of oily seeds, the stored lipid molecules of sphaerosomes are hydrolysed by the enzyme lipase to glycerol and fatty acids. The long chain fatty acids are then broken down by successive removal of two carbon fragments in the process of $\\beta$-oxidation.\nPeroxisomes are present in all photosynthetic cells of higher plants in etiolated leaf tissue. It is the site of hydrogen peroxide metabolism and glycolate cycle.\nMitochondria is the site of aerobic respiration in eukaryotic cell. It is called power house of the cell.\nDuring the development of chloroplast the first structure to appear is so called proplastid, which has a double membrane.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ75409567", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
