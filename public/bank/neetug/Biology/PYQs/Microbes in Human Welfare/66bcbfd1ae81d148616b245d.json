It is highly interactive in the root, soil, and foliar environments. Using mechanisms like competition, antibiosis, mycoparasitism, hyphal interactions, and enzyme secretion, it stunts growth, survival or infections developed by pathogens. <br/>Baculoviruses are pathogens which attack insects and other arthropods of very small size(less than a thousandth of a millimeter across) and are composed primarily of double-stranded DNA encoding for genes needed for virus establishment and reproduction. The infective baculovirus particle (virion) is protected by a protein coat called a polyhedron (plural polyhedra, Because this genetic material is easily destroyed by exposure to sunlight or through conditions in the host's gut. The ingestion of the insect baculoviruses by the host to produce infection, causing fatality to the insect. <br/>The insecticidal bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) is the most successful commercial biological control agent of insect pests. B.t. is a spore-forming bacterium that can be readily isolated on simple media such as the nutrient agar from a variety of habitats including soil, water, plants, grain dust, dead insects, and insect feces.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "ques_type": "Single correct", "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ36655628", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025dc1d4313b4e41c98ba", "616025de070db18dfc04073b", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef175", "66d58565a75f05ee8564f70b", "68091fc03a10446a207fda89"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
