A similar cloning vector named as PAC has also been developed from the bacterial P1-plasmid. BACs are mostly applied for sequencing purposes in genome projects, as they can be inserted with long size of DNA fragments.</p><p>Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) are genetically engineered chromosomes modified from the DNA of the yeast, that is further ligated into a bacterial plasmid. By insertion of large DNA fragments, around 100&ndash;1000 Kbp in size, the inserted sequences are usually cloned and then the physical mapping is employed by a process known as chromosome walking.</p>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ59644375", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
