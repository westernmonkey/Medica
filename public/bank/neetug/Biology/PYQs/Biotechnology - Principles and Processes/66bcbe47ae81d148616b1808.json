The segments of different sizes can be separated through gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis involves movement of fragments or molecules from a well created on one edge of the gel.\nEndonucleases are enzymes that produce internal cuts called cleavage in DNA molecules. A class of endonucleases cleaves DNA only within or near those sites, which have specific base sequences, such endonucleases are known as restriction endonucleases.\nThe selected vector is cut open with a restriction enzyme that has a unique target site located in the sequence where the DNA insert should be integrated to facilitate the selection of recombinant DNA.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ19296591", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
