The culture vessel A and B will undergo a transformation and new S-cells appears mixed with R-cells and in C vessel transformation does not occur, no change and only R cells will be observed. This is because the transformation principle tells that DNA is the genetic material that transforms the R-strain to S-strain and with DNase treatment, the DNA gets degraded and thus no transformation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ92160550", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
