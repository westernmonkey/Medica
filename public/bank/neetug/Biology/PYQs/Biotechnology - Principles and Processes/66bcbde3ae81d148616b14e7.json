Thus the genetic code is universal. These is no ambiguity regarding genetic code. It means that each codon codes for the same amino acid in all organisms including bacteria, plants and animals. Bacterial cells lack the machinery needed for processing of primary transcript, and hence cannot replicate human chromosome. Prokaryotic genes are polycistronic and eukaryotic genes are monocistronic which means that gene regulation is not same in both. Prokaryotic RNA does not undergo splicing.\nRelated Theory\nSplicing refers to editing of the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript into a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) wherein introns are removed and exons are joined together i.e., they are ligated. Splicing occurs within the nucleus after transcription.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ16237240", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
