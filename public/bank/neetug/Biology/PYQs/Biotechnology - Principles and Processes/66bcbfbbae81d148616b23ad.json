They have used as a vector in gene therapy to introduce the desired gene so as to replace the functioning of a defective gene</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ex: Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) is a disease caused due to a defect in the gene for the enzyme adenosine deaminase. In gene therapy against it, lymphocytes are extracted from the bone marrow of the patient. These are grown in a culture outside the body. A functional ADA rDNA, using a retroviral vector, is then introduced into these lymphocytes. These are reinjected into the patient's bone marrow.<br />\u03bb-phage allows cloning of DNA fragments up to 23 kb lengths. Ti-plasmid is usually used for plants. pBR322 is an artificial cloning vector, usually used for bacteria.</p><div>&nbsp;</div>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ20032352", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
