The analogous structures do not exhibit common origin. Unlike homology which indicates common ancestry, the analogy does not indicate common ancestry.</p><p>The wings of butterfly and of birds. Butterflies are the invertebrates whereas birds are vertebrates. The wings in both of them perform the common function of flying but the internal designs and components of these two types of wings are very different from one another.
