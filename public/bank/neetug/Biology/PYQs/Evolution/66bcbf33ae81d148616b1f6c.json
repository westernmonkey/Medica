Of the given pairs of structures, the gills of prawns and lungs of man&nbsp;are analogous in nature. Both of these are respiratory structures, which are anatomically different from each others. The lungs of man are balloon-like sac organs which inflate and deflate on breathing, while gills of prawn are crescent-shaped organs which perform gas exchange for respiration.</p><p>Wings of bat and wings of pigeon have anatomically similar structures as well as they perform the same function of flying.
