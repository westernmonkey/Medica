The brain capacities were between $650-800 \\mathrm{cc}$. They probably did not eat meat. Fossils discovered in Java in 1891 revealed the next stage, i.e. Homo erectus. Homo erectus had a large brain and probably ate meat. The Neanderthal man with a brain size of 1400 cc lived in near east and central Asia between $1,00,00-40,000$ year back. They used hides to protect their body and burried their dead. Homo sapiens arose in Africa and moved across continents and developed into distinct races.
