Divergent evolution occurs when two groups of the same species evolve different traits within those groups in order to accommodate for differing environmental and social pressures. Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over a relatively short period of time within a population. This change is due to four different processes: mutation, selection, gene flow and genetic drift. Coevolution refers to the evolution of at least two species, which occurs in a mutually dependent manner.\nRelated Theory\nAs bat's wing and bird's wing have similar structure and origin i.e., they have bony structures hence, they are called homologous organs, showing divergent evolution. Bat's wing is analogous to the wing of an insect, because the wing of an insect does not have a bony structure, it has membranous wing. So bat's wing and insect's wing are analogous showing convergent evolution, because they have similar functions but do not have the same origin and structure.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ49967634", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
