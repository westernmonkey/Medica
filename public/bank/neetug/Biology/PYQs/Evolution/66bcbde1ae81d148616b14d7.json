They compared the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a multiathenic sample of more than 100 people representing four continents. The greater the difference between the mtDNAs of two peoples, the longer ago that mtDNAs diverged from a common source. By using bioinformarics, they concluded that the divergence of mtDNA of Africans from common source began just 200, 000 years ago, much to late to represent the dispersal of Homo erectus. Thus, there are greater variation in Asia than in Africa.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ55252756", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
