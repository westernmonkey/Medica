Chimpanzees are genetically closest to humans, and in fact, chimpanzees share about $98.6 \\%$ of our DNA. Some similarities between human and chimpanzee in the chromosome banding pattern in sex chromosomes, autosomes and mitochondria. There is little difference in banding pattern in chromosomes 3 and 6 in human and chimpanzee. Serum test indicate maximum homology between human and chimpanzee.\nRelated Theory\nHumans and monkeys are both primates. But humans are not descended from monkeys or any other primate living today. We do share a common ape ancestor with chimpanzees. It lived between 8 and 6 million years ago. They determined that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than gorillas.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ26703588", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
