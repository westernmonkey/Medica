So they do not take part in recombination. In addition, mtDNA has a higher mutation rate then nuclear DNA so that it is more useful for short term evolutionary studies.\nRelated Theory\nThe Ychromosomeisinheritedfromthefather; therefore, paternal social class was included in the Y chromosome analysis. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother; thus, maternal social class was included in the analysis along with paternal social class for mitochondrial DNA. More than $27 \\%$ of the variance in Y-haplogroups can be attributed to differences between populations, whereas mtDNA showed much lower heterogeneity between populations (less than 5\\%), suggesting a strong influence of patrilocal social structure.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ20076990", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
