In 1831 Darwin got an opportunity to travel by $\\mathrm{H}$ M S Beagle for a voyage of world exploration. Beagle sailed to the Galapagos Islands, here Darwin found a living laboratory of evolution. The common birds of Galapagos Islands, the finches were markedly different from the finches of main land. The closely related species of finches had beaks of different shapes and sizes and adapted for feeding on completely different diet showing adaptive radiation.\nThe transitional fossil forms, which show characteristic of two different groups of living animals are called connecting links, eg, Archaeapteryx, Seymouria etc.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ67713287", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
