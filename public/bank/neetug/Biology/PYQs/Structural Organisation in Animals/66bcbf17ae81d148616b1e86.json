Tracheae are known to balance the pressure inside the system. When oxygenrich air enters into the body of the cockroach via spiracles into the tracheal tubes, it diffuses into\nvarious tissues and cells of the body. Here, oxygen is used up to liberate energy. Likewise, carbon-dioxide rich air passes into the trachea and moves to the outwards through the spiracles. Carbon dioxide is given out as a result of the respiratory process.

When air enters the tracheoles, oxygen diffuses faster into the tissues due to its high partial pressure. At the same time the carbon dioxide of tissues, instead of passing into the tracheal system, goes into the haemolymph. Carbon dioxide is carried more quickly into the haemolymph due to its greater solubility in it. This carbon dioxide accumulates near the spiracles and diffuses in to the atrial chambers near the spiracles and goes out in bursts through the abdominal spiracles.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ10676803", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
