Areolar connective tissue is a type of connective tissue which are widely distributed in the body and primarily serves the function as a packing material between the other tissues.\r\n2. Some functions of the areolar connective tissue are as follows:\r\na. It provides a protective framework that keeps major structures in place providing support.\r\nb. It also contains mast cells which prevent infection.\r\nc. The areolar tissue is also dense with collagen fibers, which makes it strong and rigid.\r\nExplanation of the incorrect option:\r\nOption A:\r\nLigaments are the connective tissues that join bones to bones.\r\nOption B:\r\nBones are joined with muscles with the help of tendons.\r\nOption C:\r\nFat bodies are connected to muscles via adipose tissues.\r\nFinal answer: Areolar connective tissue joins integument with muscles.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ02901776", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "updatedAt": "2024-09-02T06:45:13.139Z", "updated_by": "65d0c176a8f74604505ba6f6", "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
