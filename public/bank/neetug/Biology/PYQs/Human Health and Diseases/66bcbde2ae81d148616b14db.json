T lymphocytes provide cell mediated immunity. B cells, which mature in the bone marrow, are responsible for antibody-mediated immunity.\nRelated Theory\nImmature T lymphocytes are cells that have not yet encountered their specific antigen. In peripheral lymphoid organs, they can interact with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which use MHC molecules to present antigen. Once the $T$ lymphocytes recognise their specific antigens, they proliferate and differentiate into one of several effector $T$ lymphocyte subsets. Effector T lymphocytes interact with host cells (rather than the pathogen) to carry out their immune function. T lymphocytes use co-receptors to bind to the MHC molecules. Co-receptors can be either CD4 or $C D_8$. CD proteins help to differentiate major groups of effector $T$ lymphocytes. immature $C_{8+} T$ lymphocytes will become cytotoxic $T$ lymphocytes. Alternatively, $C D_{{ }^{+}} T$ lymphocytes will become $T$ helper lymphocytes, each of which specialised for particular tasks.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ47615346", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
