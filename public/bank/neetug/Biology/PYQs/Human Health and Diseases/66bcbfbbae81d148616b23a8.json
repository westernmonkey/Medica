When it senses these foreign invaders, it sends out an army of fighter cells to attack them.<br />Normally, the immune system can tell the difference between foreign cells and your own cells.<br />In an autoimmune disease, the immune system mistakes part of your body &mdash; like your joints or skin &mdash; as foreign. Thus, it loses its ability to differentiate between the self and non-self antigens.&nbsp;In response to these antigens, it&nbsp;releases proteins called antibodies that attack healthy cells.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ex- Rheumatoid arthritis, Psoriasis, vitiligo</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Alzheimer&#39;s disease is not an autoimmune disease. It is a progressive disorder caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time.
