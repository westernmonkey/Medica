They are named T cells because they mature in the thymus, a gland found in the chest. There are three types of T cell lymphocytes:\r\n- Cytotoxic T cell\r\n- Suppressor T cell\r\n- Helper T cell\r\nHelper T cells are arguably the most important cells in adaptive immunity, as they are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. They not only help activate \\(B\\) cells to secrete antibodies and macrophages to destroy ingested microbes, but they also help activate cytotoxic \\(T\\) cells to kill infected target cells. A cytotoxic T cell is a Tlymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) that kills cancer cells, cells that are infected (particularly with viruses), or cells that are damaged in other ways. The regulatory T cells formerly known as suppressor T cells are a subpopulation of T cells that modulate the immune system, maintain tolerance to self-antigens, and prevent autoimmune disease.\r\nSo, the correct answer is 'There are three main types-cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells, and suppressor T-cells'.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGNEPYQ09798622", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "updatedAt": "2024-09-03T16:53:17.979Z", "updated_by": "65d0c176a8f74604505ba6f6", "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
