The first anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium was identified in 1901 and was subsequently described as <em>Rhodospirillum</em> species. <em>Rhodospirillum</em> species are purple bacteria that belong to the phylum Proteobacteria, and the term \"purple bacteria\", which refers to a major group among anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria. None of the anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria have the ability to use water as an electron donor (or cannot oxidize water), and, thus, perform photosynthesis using sulfide, hydrogen or organic substrates. Therefore, photosynthesis by these bacteria does not involve oxygen.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a44946f4e4a198e5b3", "616025a562fb272c4efefe85", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef185", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f659", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1b", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda66"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
