It is the process of synthesizing energy-rich ATP molecules by transferring the phosphate group into the ADP molecule in the presence of light. It is of two types: cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.<br />Meanwhile, substrate-level phosphorylation refers to the formation of ATP from ADP and a phosphorylated intermediate, rather than from ADP and inorganic phosphate, Pi, as is done in oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation.<br />Thus, photophosphorylation does not involve substrate-level phosphorylation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a44946f4e4a198e5b3", "616025a562fb272c4efefe85", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef185", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f659", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1b", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda66"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
