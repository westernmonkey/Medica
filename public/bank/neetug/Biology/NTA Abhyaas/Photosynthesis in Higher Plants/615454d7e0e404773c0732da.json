These electrons are picked up by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transportsystem consisting of cytochromes. This movement of electrons is downhill, in terms of an oxidation-reduction or redox potential scale. The electrons are not used up as they pass through the electron transport chain, but are passed on to the pigments of photosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons in the reaction centre of PS I are also excited when they receive red light of wavelength 700 nm and are transferred to another accepter molecule that has a greater redox potential. These electrons then are moved downhill again, this time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP+. The addition of these electrons reduces  <math><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">N</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">D</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow></msup></math>  to NADPH +  <math><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">H</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow></msup></math> .
