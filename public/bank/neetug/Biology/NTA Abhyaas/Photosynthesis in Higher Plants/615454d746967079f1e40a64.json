He took a bell jar in which he placed a burning candle where he found out that candles blew out. In the second performance, he took a bell jar and close the jar where he finds out that the mouse will die due to the absence of oxygen. In the last step, he places a mint plant with candle and mouse he finds out that all were alive. He came to the conclusion that plants release oxygen and this oxygen will be used by candle for burning and the mouse will use in respiration and in return carbon dioxide will be released by mouse and that will be used by plants for photosynthesis. Joseph Priestley told that plants and animals restore the air for each other.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a44946f4e4a198e5b3", "616025a562fb272c4efefe85", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef185", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f659", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1b", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda66"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
