The peculiarity of these plants is that their stomata are closed during the day and opens at night when the temperature is low. This characteristic feature enables the CAM plants to minimize photorespiration and helps them survive in dry conditions or when exposed to high temperatures. The opening of stomata at night helps them to diffuse carbon dioxide in their leaves which is then further converted to malate and other organic acids by the enzyme PEP carboxylase.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a44946f4e4a198e5b3", "616025a562fb272c4efefe85", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef185", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f659", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1b", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda66"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
