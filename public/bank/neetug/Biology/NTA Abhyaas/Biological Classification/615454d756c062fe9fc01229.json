These organisms have cell wall which is made of chitin unlike cellulose seen in plants. The commonly consumed mushroom and toadstool are included in this kingdom. These organisms are achlorophyllous as they are all non-photosynthetic.<br/><br/>Kingdom Monera includes all the prokaryotic organisms including the autotrophic and heterotrophic groups. These have non-cellulosic cell wall like Fungi but it contains varying concentration of peptidoglycan. All bacteria are included in this kingdom.<br/><br/>Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes. Protozoans, Euglenoids, Dinoflagellates are included in this group. Organisms in the kingdom are primarily aquatic and some show presence of flagella and cilia.<br/><br/>All the chlorophyll containing eukaryotes are included in the kingdom Plantae. All the organisms in it have cell wall made of cellulose and are autotrophic (some partial autotrophic- insectivorous plant).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
