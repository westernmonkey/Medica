Many of these organisms exhibit characteristics of both plants and animals. In this many of them have 2 flagella that emerges out of the cytostome through cytopharynx and are motile. Out of the two flagella, one is short and the other one is a long one. Instead of cell walls, they have a protein-rich pellicle that helps in maintaining the definite shape of the body. Nutrition in Euglena is accomplished by holophytic (able to synthesize organic compounds by photosynthesis) or saprophytic (those organisms get its nourishment from dead organisms) or both so they show the mixotrophic mode of nutrition.&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
