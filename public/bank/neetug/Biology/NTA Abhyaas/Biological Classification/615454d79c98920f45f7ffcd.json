So in this way, both partners are mutually benefited and they show symbiosis. It represents an example of mutualism and Lichens are sensitive to oxide of sulphur and thus are indicators of pollution so they do not grow near a smoky polluted industrial area. Mycobiont in Lichens is usually belongs to Ascomycetes or Basidiomycetes or Deuteromycetes while the phycobiont belongs to Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Phaeophyceae.
