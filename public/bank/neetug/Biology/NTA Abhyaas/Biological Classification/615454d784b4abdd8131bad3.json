He used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups; those which had red blood and those that did not. In Linnaeus' time, a two-kingdom system of classification with Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all plants and animals, respectively. This system did not distinguish between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi) organisms.<br />R.H.
