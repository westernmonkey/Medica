Protozoans, Euglenoids, Dinoflagellates are included in this group. Organisms in the kingdom are primarily aquatic and some show presence of flagella and cilia. photosynthetic. It also includes the Slime moulds which are the saphrophytic protists. Slime moulds are found engulfing organic matter from the dead decaying plant body. These groups are generally multi-nucleated, without any proper cell divider and stripped cytoplasm. They are known to form an aggregate called plasmodium under favarouble conditions that can grow upto several feet. The plasmodium breaks and differentiates into fruiting bodies forming spores under unfavarouble conditions.<br/><br/>Euglenoids are unicellular protists with flagella but no cell wall. They can perform photosynthesis as their cell structure contains chlorophyll.<br/><br/>The kingdom Monera includes all the prokaryotic celled organisms. Prokaryotes are organisms whose cells lack a well-defined nucleus. All the bacterial groups are included in Monera as well since bacteria have a prokaryotic cell structure. Cyanobacteria are a group of free-living photosynthetic bacteria that perform oxygenic photosynthetic process which are included in the kingdom Monera.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
