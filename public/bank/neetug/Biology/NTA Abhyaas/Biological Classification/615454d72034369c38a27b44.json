They are a heterotrophic organism that does not contain chlorophyll and obtains its nutrition by absorption. The sequence of events in the fungal sexual cycle is plasmogamy, karyogamy, and then meiosis. In plasmogamy, the cytoplasm of two cells fuses with each other. In karyogamy, nuclei of two cells fuse with each other result in the formation of the zygote that will be diploid. After the formation of the zygote, meiosis occurs. Meiosis is also called reduction division that makes haploid cells. Due to which haploid stage of fungi gets established.&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
