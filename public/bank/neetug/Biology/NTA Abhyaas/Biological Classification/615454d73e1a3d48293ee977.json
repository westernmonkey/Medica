Under favorable conditions, they form an aggregation called plasmodium which may grow and spread over several feet. During adverse conditions, this plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodies bearing spores at their tips. They are highly resistant and survive for many years, even under adverse conditions. Their spores are dispersed by air currents.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
