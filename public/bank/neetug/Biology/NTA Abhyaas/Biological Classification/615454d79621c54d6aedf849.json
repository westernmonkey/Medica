The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are characterized by having an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell. In addition to proteins viruses also contain genetic material, that could be either RNA or DNA. In general, viruses that infect plants have single stranded RNA. Viroid is a new infectious agent that is smaller than viruses and causes potato spindle tuber disease. It was found to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses, hence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025787cda8c2a99be0c08", "616025793be62cd594bb1ef7", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16b", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5da", "67fdff50378e1624ea7b6a12", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
