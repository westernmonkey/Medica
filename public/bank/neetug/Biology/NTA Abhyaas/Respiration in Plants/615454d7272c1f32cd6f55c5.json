Peter Mitchell (1961) put forward a hypothesis known as chemiosmotic hypothesis for ATP synthesis. According to this when electrons flow from duel proton, electron carrier to a non-hydrogen carrier the H<sup>+</sup> are released and expelled into the intermembrane space and thus creates a proton gradient with higher concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in the inter membranous space than the matrix. Due to proton motive force the protons flow back and energy liberated during this back flow of protons activate ATPase [present in F<sub>1</sub> head to synthesize ATP].", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259f82dd259bc6fdf1da", "616025a0878becffa543d409", "64eb06d63118f713ecfef161", "66d58550a75f05ee8564f648", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6919", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda7d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
