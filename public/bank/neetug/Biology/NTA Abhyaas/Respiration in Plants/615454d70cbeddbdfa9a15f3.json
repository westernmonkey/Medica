This pathway is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons from NADH (produced in the mitochondria matrix) are oxidized by an NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) and are transferred to ubiquinone (Complex II). The reduced ubiquinone (ubiquinol) is then oxidised with the transfer of electrons to cytochrome c via cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III). Cytochrome c is a small protein attached to the outer surface of the inner membrane and acts as a mobile carrier for transfer of electrons between complex III and IV.&nbsp;Complex IV refers to cytochrome c oxidase complex containing cytochromes a and a<sub>3</sub>, with two copper centres. When the electrons pass from one carrier to another via complex I to IV in the electron transport chain, they are coupled to ATP synthase (complex V). This coupling is necessary for the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259f82dd259bc6fdf1da", "616025a0878becffa543d409", "64eb06d63118f713ecfef161", "66d58550a75f05ee8564f648", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6919", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda7d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
