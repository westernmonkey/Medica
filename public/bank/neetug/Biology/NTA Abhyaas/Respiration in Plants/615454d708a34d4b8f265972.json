During the process of aerobic respiration, phosphorylation of ADP occurs forming the energy currency molecule - Adenosine triphosphate. The energy required for the production of proton gradient which is needed for phosphorylation is obtained from the oxidation-reduction of the molecules. One of the steps of the respiration process is glycolysis where 6C-glucose is broken down to 3C-pyruvate.<br /><br />Glycolysis is a catabolic process where the substrate glucose is broken down into smaller molecules- pyruvic acid and occurs anaerobically. The site for glycolysis is the cytoplasm. It is a stepwise process involving a series of ten enzymes to catalyze the processes. The first step in glycolysis is the phosphorylation of the glucose molecule to glucose-6-phosphate which is catalyzed by enzyme hexokinase with&nbsp;<math><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mo>+ as cofactor.</mo></mrow></msup></math>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259f82dd259bc6fdf1da", "616025a0878becffa543d409", "64eb06d63118f713ecfef161", "66d58550a75f05ee8564f648", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6919", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda7d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
