There are various such methods. The famous is the test tube baby. In this the sperms and eggs are collected and are fertilised in the test tube. This results in formation of zygote. The zygote forms an embryo and then starts cleavage. This fertilised product is then transferred to the female body for further development. If the fertilised embryo has less than 8 blastomeres it is transferred into the fallopian tube but if the embryo has more than 8 blastomeres it is transferred into the uterus so that it can get implanted there. This is known as IUT (Intrauterine transport).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025be8549504b724745b9", "616025c0f46cf5ec64502e0f", "64eb07173118f713ecfef3cd", "66d585cfa75f05ee8564fae0", "68091fd13a10446a207fdb3d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
