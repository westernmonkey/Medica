The zygote is grown inside a culture and when the embryo is formed, it is then implanted into the uterus where it develops into a foetus and then into a child. This is called a test-tube baby.<br /><br />The methodology involves the following steps:<br />- Removal of the unfertilized ovum from the reproductive tract of a female.<br />- Ovum is kept under aseptic conditions.<br />- The fusion of sperm and ovum in a culture medium, outside the female body to form the zygote.<br />- A zygote is stimulated to develop in vitro upto 32-celled stage.<br />- Developing an embryo is implanted on the endometrium of the uterus at a 32-celled stage. So the pregnancy in the woman starts and further the development of the child continues in the womb till it is born.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025be8549504b724745b9", "616025c0f46cf5ec64502e0f", "64eb07173118f713ecfef3cd", "66d585cfa75f05ee8564fae0", "68091fd13a10446a207fdb3d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
