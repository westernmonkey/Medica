Examples of such techniques are GIFT (Gamete intra fallopian transfer), ZIFT (Zygote intra fallopian transfer), AI (Artificial insemination), IUT (Intra uterine transfer), ICSI (Intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) etc. ICSI is a technique in which embryo is formed in the lab by directly infusing sperm inside the ovum. It can be considered as IVF technique (In -vitro fertilization) but it is very different from traditional IVF. In the traditional procedure, the sperms and egg are collected in a petri dish and allowed to fertilise but in ICSI single sperm is injected within the ovum.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025be8549504b724745b9", "616025c0f46cf5ec64502e0f", "64eb07173118f713ecfef3cd", "66d585cfa75f05ee8564fae0", "68091fd13a10446a207fdb3d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
