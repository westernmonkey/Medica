The external ear consists of the pinna, auditory canal, and tympanum. The tympanum is a connection between the external and middle ear. The middle ear consists of ear ossicles: the malleus, incus, and stapes. The inner ear consists of a bony labyrinth within it is a membranous labyrinth. Bony labyrinth consists of two openings: foramen ovale and foramen rotundum. The inner ear consists of the cochlea and vestibular apparatus. Cochlea consists of three chambers. The middle chamber consists of organ of Corti that rests on the basilar membrane.<br /><br />Human eye consists of three layers: Outer fibrous layer, middle vascular layer and inner layer retina. Retina shows presence of blind spot on the lateral end. This is the optic disc area from where optic nerve exits. Lateral to the blind spot there is a yellowish area known as macula lutea and central pit of it is known as fovea centralis. This spot is said to have maximum visual acuity.<br /><br />Cerebrum of the brain shows the presence of the limbic system which is also involved in the regulation of sexual behavior, emotions, etc.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b1f56d2b31cc12d2e8", "616025b2893124f0f978f93a", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef150", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e3", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69b2", "68091fc13a10446a207fda8f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
