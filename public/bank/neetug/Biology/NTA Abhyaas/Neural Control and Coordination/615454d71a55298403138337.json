The process of moving sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane is an active transport process involving the hydrolysis of ATP to provide the necessary energy. This process is responsible for maintaining the large excess of Na<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>outside the cell and the large excess of K<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>ions on the inside. This accomplishes the transport of three Na<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>to the outside of the cell and the transport of the two K<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>ions to the inside. This unbalanced charge transfer contributes to the separation of the charge across the membrane. The sodium-potassium pump is an important contributor to the action potential produced by the nerve cells.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b1f56d2b31cc12d2e8", "616025b2893124f0f978f93a", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef150", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e3", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69b2", "68091fc13a10446a207fda8f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
