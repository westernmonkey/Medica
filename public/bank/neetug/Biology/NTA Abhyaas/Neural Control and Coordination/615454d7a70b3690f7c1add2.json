This is how they control the focal length to focus on an object. The contraction of ciliary muscles releases the suspensory ligaments and allows the lens to become convex and <strong>the relaxation of these muscles makes the lens stretched</strong>. As the ciliary muscles are involved in the accommodation required for close vision, the loss of their contraction capability would not cause loss of vision but would affect the close vision only. <strong>Hence, we can conclude that if the ciliary muscle fails&nbsp;to contract, the lens will become thin and stretched.</strong></p>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b1f56d2b31cc12d2e8", "616025b2893124f0f978f93a", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef150", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e3", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69b2", "68091fc13a10446a207fda8f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
