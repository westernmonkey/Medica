It is responsible for the voluntary motor movements in a co-ordinated manner and also involved in the balance and posture of an individual. The information received by the sensory system is processed by the cerebellum to give the motor output like balancing. It has the grey and white matter in it, where the white matter is myelinated. The white matter in cerebellum spreads like a tree branching into the grey matter which is called Arborvitae. It supplies sensory and motor information to the cerebellum<br/><br/>Cerebellum contains large neurons called Purkinje cells found in its cerebellar cortex called Purkinje layer. These cells are named after Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b, who discovered it. These cells control the output signals of the cerebellum by inhibiting the deep cerebellar nuclei and vestibular nuclei neurons.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b1f56d2b31cc12d2e8", "616025b2893124f0f978f93a", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef150", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e3", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69b2", "68091fc13a10446a207fda8f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
