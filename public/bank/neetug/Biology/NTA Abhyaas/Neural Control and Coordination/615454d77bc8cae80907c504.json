The cerebral cortex is the layer of cells that covers the cerebral hemisphere. It is thrown into prominent folds. Because of its greyish appearance, the cerebral cortex is also termed as grey matter. Cell bodies of neurons are concentrated here. It possesses various areas: Motor areas, sensory areas, and large association areas. Association areas are neither sensory nor motor in function. These regions are responsible for mediating complex functions like- intersensory associations, memory, and communication.<br /><br />II. The brain stem is made up of 3 structures - Midbrain, pons varolii, and medulla. Pons varolii and medulla are parts of the hindbrain.<br /><br />III. The choroid is thin in its posterior 2/3rd but becomes thick in its anterior part to form the ciliary body. Iris is a pigmented and opaque structure formed by the anterior continuation of the ciliary body. The Colour of the eyes is because of the color of iris.<br /><br />IV. The inner ear is fluid-filled and divisible mainly into 2 parts :<br />A. Bony labyrinth - It is a series of bony channels inside which the membranous labyrinth lies. It is filled with perilymph.<br />B. Membranous labyrinth - It is filled with a fluid called endolymph. It consists of the cochlea + vestibular apparatus.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b1f56d2b31cc12d2e8", "616025b2893124f0f978f93a", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef150", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e3", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69b2", "68091fc13a10446a207fda8f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
