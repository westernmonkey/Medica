The hypothalamus forms an important part of the limbic system. It has centres which regulate body temperature and appetite. Thus, a hypothalamic tumour will result in low body temperature and loss of appetite. The hypothalamic nuclei are responsible for the secretion of the hormone vasopressin. This hormone is responsible for reabsorption of water and electrolytes from the renal tubules. This prevents excessive urination and dehydration. A hypothalamic tumour will affect the synthesis of vasopressin, which will lead to excessive urination, excessive thirst and dehydration.<br /><br />A tumour in pons will lead to loss of coordination, as it contains fibres which connect different regions of the brain.<br /><br />A tumour in cerebellum will lead to lack of balance, as the cerebellum is responsible for maintenance of balance.<br /><br />A tumour in medulla oblongata can prove to be very fatal, as the medulla has the center which regulates the cardiorespiratory activities.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b1f56d2b31cc12d2e8", "616025b2893124f0f978f93a", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef150", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e3", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69b2", "68091fc13a10446a207fda8f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
