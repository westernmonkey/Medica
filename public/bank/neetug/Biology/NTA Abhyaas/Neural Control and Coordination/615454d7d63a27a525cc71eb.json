This apparatus is made up of semicircular canals that are three in number and one otolith organ. The three semicircular canals are at right angles to each other and this is known as orthogonal position. These are named as superior, horizontal and posterior according to their positions. One end of each canal is swollen to form a dilated region known as ampulla which contains a ridge known as crista ampullaris. Each cristae has cupula gel and hair cells and these are responsible for maintenance of balance and posture of body.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b1f56d2b31cc12d2e8", "616025b2893124f0f978f93a", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef150", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e3", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69b2", "68091fc13a10446a207fda8f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
