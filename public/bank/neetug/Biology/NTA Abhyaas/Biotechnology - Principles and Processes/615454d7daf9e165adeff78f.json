Transformants are bacterial cells which have successfully accepted the DNA sequence of our choice. To enable the process the cells are made competent to take in the desired DNA sequence as the DNA cannot pass through the cell membrane directly. The cells are first treated with calcium cation to increase the efficiency of DNA uptake. The cells are then kept on ice with the recombinant DNA followed by heat treatment at 42 degree Celsius for short period and again on ice. This treatment helps the bacterial cell to take in the rDNA sequence easily.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
