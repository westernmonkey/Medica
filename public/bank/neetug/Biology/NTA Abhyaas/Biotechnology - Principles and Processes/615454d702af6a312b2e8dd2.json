Vectors are also used for making copies or clones. Origin of replication (ori) in a vector enable replication of the vector and vector supporting higher copy number is preferred. Some bacteria have been known to have copy number of plasmids from 15-100. Vector having a selectable marker is preferred as it will help in identifying the transformant from non-transformants. Vector with few or single restriction enzyme sites preferred to avoid fragmentation of the DNA sequence and reduce complication of the biotechnological process. Plasmids and bacteriophages are preferred as cloning vectors from transferring gene. pBR322 is one of the most used plasmids which has the tetracycline resistant gene  <math><mo>(</mo><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">R</mi></mrow></msup><mo>)</mo></math>  which has restriction site for enzyme BamH I.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
