Hence we will select Eukaryotic organisms. The gene is unidentified and hence for cloning restriction endunucleases cannot be used as these enzymes recognise specific sites only. Hence now we need to transcribe this gene to produce cDNA. Then by using a suitable vector like plasmid vector this cDNA is transformed into the eukaryotic cells and then screening is done to check the colonies whether they glow in dark or not.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
