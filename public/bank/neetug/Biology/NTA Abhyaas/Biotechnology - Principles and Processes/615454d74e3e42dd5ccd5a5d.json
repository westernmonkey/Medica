The pathogen has the ability to deliver a piece of DNA, known as T-DNA, which has an ability to transform normal plant cells into tumour cells. These tumour cells produce the chemicals which are needed by the pathogen. The tumour inducing plasmid (Ti plasmid) of <em>Agrobacterium tumifaciens</em> is now being used as a cloning vector for transferring the gene of interest in the host. The researchers have eliminated the ability of the plasmid to cause the tumour, and have retained its properties of transferring DNA to the plants.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
