The purified DNA molecules are incubated with restriction enzymes at optimal conditions for carrying out restriction enzyme digestions. The progress of a restriction enzyme digestion is checked with the help of Agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA being a negatively charged molecule moves towards the positive electrode. Similar process is repeated with the vector DNA. The 'gene of interest' obtained from the source DNA and also vector DNA obtained by restriction enzyme digestion are mixed and then ligase is added to it. This leads to formation of recombinant DNA.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
