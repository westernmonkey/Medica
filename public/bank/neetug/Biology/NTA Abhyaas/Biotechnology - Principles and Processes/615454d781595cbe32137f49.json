The agarose gel has equal sized pores in which the bigger fragment will move slower than the smaller one supporting separation of the nucleic acids.<br /><br />These endonucleases make specific cut at specific sequence of the DNA called as recognition site. These sequences are palindromic in nature. As the sequences are specific, these enzymes can be used to make cuts and alter DNA sequence in almost all types of cells. The sequence size or length will vary depending on the type or size of protein it expresses.<br /><br />AGE will help in separating the DNA sequences as per the size/length and assist in monitoring progress of enzyme digestion", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
