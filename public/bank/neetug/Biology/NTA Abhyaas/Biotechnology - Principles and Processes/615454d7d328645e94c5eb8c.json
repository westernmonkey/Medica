Several methods have been developed for introduction of recombinant DNA molecule into host cells.</p><p>(i)&nbsp;<b>Heat shock method&nbsp;</b>\u2013 In this method, DNA is treated with a specific concentration of a divalent cation, such as calcium which increases the efficiency with which DNA enters the bacterium through pores in its cell wall. The rDNA is forced into the cell by incubating the cell with rDNA on ice followed by placing them briefly &nbsp; &nbsp;(heat shock) and then patting them back on ice. This enables the bacteria to take up the rDNA.</p><p>(ii)<b>&nbsp;Micro Injection</b>&nbsp;\u2013 In this technique foreign DNA is directly and forcibly injected into the nucleus of animal and plant cells through a glass micropipette containing very fine tip of about 0.5 mm diameter.</p><p align=\"left\">(iii)&nbsp;<b>Gene gun or biolistics</b>&nbsp;\u2013 In this method, cells are bombarded with high velocity micro particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA.</p>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
