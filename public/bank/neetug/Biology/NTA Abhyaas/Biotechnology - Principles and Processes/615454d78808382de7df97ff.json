To make multiple copies of a plasmid (a small circular DNA), it should be inserted into a bacterium. A plasmid would not replicate if it were inserted into a virus, as viruses do not contain plasmid and don't have the necessary conditions for its replication. Treating the plasmid with a restriction enzyme will cut into smaller fragments, rendering the plasmid useless. Running the plasmid on a gel (using gel electrophoresis) would only tell us the size of the plasmid and not make clones or copies.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
