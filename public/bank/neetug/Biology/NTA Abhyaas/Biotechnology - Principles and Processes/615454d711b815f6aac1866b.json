Endonucleases are very important as these are enzymes that break the DNA molecules, These are termed as endonucleases as these can cut the DNA molecule at various sites except the ends. The Endonucleases can be Restriction Endonucleases as these cut the DNA molecules at specific sites. These recognize a specific palindromic sequences in the DNA. Palindromic sequences are those that can be read from forward and backward in the same way. Example: GAATTC is on one strand then the other strand will have CTTAAG. These are the palindrome sequence. Approximately 900 such enzymes have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
