It was found that HindII always cuts DNA molecules at a particular point by recognizing a specific sequence of six base pairs. This specific base sequence is known as the recognition sequence for HindII. Besides Hind II, today we know more than 900 restriction enzymes that have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria, each of which recognizes different recognition sequences.
