The name of Restriction endonuclease is made of 4 parts. The first part is made of a single capital letter (in italics) which comes from the genus name of the bacterium The second part is made of 2 small letters which comes from the species name of the bacterium. The third part is made of a single letter (not in italics) which comes from the strain of the bacterium. The fourth part is made of a Roman numeral (not in italics) indicating the order of discovery. EcoR I is a restriction endonuclease isolated from bacterium Esherichia (E) coli (co) strain RY 13 (R) and it is the first endonuclease (I) to be isolated from this strain.
