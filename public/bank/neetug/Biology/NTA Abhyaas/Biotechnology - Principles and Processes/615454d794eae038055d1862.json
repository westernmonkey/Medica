In order to cut the DNA with the help of restruiction enzymes the DNA has to be in a pure form and should be free from other macromolecules. For the release of DNA with other macromolecules like RNA, proteins, polysaccharides and also lipids the cell needs to break open. This is achieved by treating the cell with enzymes like lysozymes, cellulose, etc. The RNA is removed by ribonuclease and proteins by proteases. Similarly other macromolecules are removed by appropriate enzymes and finally DNA can be precipitated out as a collection of fine threads in the suspension after adding chilled ethyl alcohol.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
