There are huge varieties of enzyme specific for a particular substrate and they are categorized as per their activity. The enzyme group that break nucleic acids or long chain polynucleotides is called nucleases. Depending on where they make the break in the chain, there are two categories - exonucleases which break nucleotides at the terminal part of the chain and endonucleases which make the break within the chain. These enzymes make the break or 'cut' at a particular site or sequence (palindromic); they are also called restriction endonucleases. These biocatalysts are extensively used in the genetic engineering process for manipulation of genes. Because of their cutting ability like a scissors, they are commonly called as molecular scissors.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e7231d150595f071ea", "616025e8f84b7fd2ad678d41", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef244", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f618", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b692c", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda53"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
