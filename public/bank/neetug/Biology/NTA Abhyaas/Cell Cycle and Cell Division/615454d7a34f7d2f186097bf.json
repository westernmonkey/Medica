Karyokinesis deals with nuclear division where at the end of this stage two nuclei are formed. Following karyokinesis, cytokinesis occurs where the cytoplasm is divided in two resulting in formation of two new whole individual cells. The given diagram represent the cytokinesis stage of plant cell division. In it, the division occurs by making a cell plate in the cytoplasm between the two newly formed nuclei which later becomes the cell wall of the new cell that will form.<br/><br/>Diakinesis is part of prophase I of meiosis I which is part of karyokinesis.<br/><br/>DNA synthesis is part of S -phase in interphase.<br/><br/>Interphase is the stage of cell cycle that occurs between two cell division processes.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258f8fcd4a56da235ad1", "6160258e3b31e13c06dc70b4", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef130", "66d58564a75f05ee8564f704", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6913", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
