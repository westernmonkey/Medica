It is further divided into five phases. 1) Leptotene: condensation of chromatin material takes place in this stage 2) Zygotene: The homologous chromosome formation is seen in this stage. This is known as synapsis and this is also facilitated by the formation of synaptonemal complex. 3) Pachytene: At this point, a tetrad of chromosomes is formed and this is known as bivalent. Crossing over is also seen in this stage. 4) Diplotene: The synaptonemal complex degrades and chiasmata formation is seen. 5) Diakinesis: This is the final stage of prophase. Here the chromosomes condense further. Four proper tetrads are visible. During this stage, terminalization is seen.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258f8fcd4a56da235ad1", "6160258e3b31e13c06dc70b4", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef130", "66d58564a75f05ee8564f704", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6913", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
