It is a metabolically very active phase because of the biosynthesis of a number of molecules. It is divided into G1, S and G2 phases/sub-stages. The M phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends with the division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis).&nbsp;G1 phase is also called the growth phase or post-mitotic phase.<br /><br />G1 phase is the longest phase of interphase; the maximum increase in the cell size occurs during this phase. In this phase, there is an active synthesis of RNA and proteins. G1 phase is the interval between the M and S phases.&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258f8fcd4a56da235ad1", "6160258e3b31e13c06dc70b4", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef130", "66d58564a75f05ee8564f704", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6913", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
