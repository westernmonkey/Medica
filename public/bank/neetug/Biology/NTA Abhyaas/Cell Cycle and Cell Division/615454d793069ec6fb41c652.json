In this phase, the DNA of the cell is duplicated marking the decision of the cell to enter divisional stage. Mitosis is one of the two cell-division processes where the outcome is two daughter cells who are identical to the parent cell. Since new cells formed as equal/same in every aspect, this division is also called as equational division. Meiosis is the other type of division where the daughter cells formed have half the genetic content of the parent cell (also called as reductional division since the chromosome number is reduced). Crossing over is a step observed in the prophase I of meiotic I division stage, where the non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange their genetic materials as homologous chromosomes have their genes in the same location compared with non-homologous chromosomes.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258f8fcd4a56da235ad1", "6160258e3b31e13c06dc70b4", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef130", "66d58564a75f05ee8564f704", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6913", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
