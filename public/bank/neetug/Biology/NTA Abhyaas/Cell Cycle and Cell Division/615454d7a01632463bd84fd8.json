These stages mainly involve the reductional and equational division of the cells. In the first meiotic division, the chromosome number is reduced to half (haploid condition) and the chromatids move to the opposite poles. In the second meiotic division which resembles normal mitosis, there is the formation of four gametes and the chromosomes are distributed to each gamete, therefore the second meiotic division is required for the segregation of the replicated chromosome.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258f8fcd4a56da235ad1", "6160258e3b31e13c06dc70b4", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef130", "66d58564a75f05ee8564f704", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6913", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
