Meiosis is the reductional division process where the chromosome number is halved in the newly formed daughter cells.  Mitosis (equational division) usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells with identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organisms is due to mitosis. Mitosis produces genetically identical daughter cells. It is not useful in repair of single cell rather useful in repair of tissue by replacing the damaged cells. Hence, statement II is not correct.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258f8fcd4a56da235ad1", "6160258e3b31e13c06dc70b4", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef130", "66d58564a75f05ee8564f704", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6913", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
