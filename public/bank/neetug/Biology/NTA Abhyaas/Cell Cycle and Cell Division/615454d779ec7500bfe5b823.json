Then, in preparation for cellular division, it increases in size. Mitosis (nuclear division) is the most dramatic stage of the cell cycle, involving a major reorganisation of virtually all components of the cell. During mitosis (Nuclear Division) the chromosome condense, the nuclear envelope of most cells break down, the cytoskeleton reorganise to form the mitotic spindle and the chromosome move to opposite pole.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258f8fcd4a56da235ad1", "6160258e3b31e13c06dc70b4", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef130", "66d58564a75f05ee8564f704", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6913", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda5f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
