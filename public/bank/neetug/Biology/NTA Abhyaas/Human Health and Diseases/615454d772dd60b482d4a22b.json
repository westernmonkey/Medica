There might be certain substances like pollen, dust, etc. present in this place to which the immune system is allergic or hypersensitive to. The immune system thus responds to this antigen in a highly exaggerated manner. The symptoms include watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, itching, etc. The antibodies which are produced in this response are of the IgE type.<br /><br />The chemicals which are released in an allergic response include histamine and serotonin which are released by the mast cells. Adrenaline has no role to play in an allergic reaction. It is a hormone produced by the adrenal medulla in situations of emergency and result into increased heart rate, etc. vasodilation, etc.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
