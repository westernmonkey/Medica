Cellular components include Erythrocytes, Leucocytes and Thrombocytes. Leucocytes can be Granulocytes and Agranulocytes depending on presence and absence of granules. Granulocytes include Neutrophils, Eosinophils and Basophils. Agranulocytes include Monocytes and Lymphocytes. Each type of Leucocyte has its own function and is important for our body. Neutrophils and Monocytes bring about phagocytosis. Basophils are important during imflammation. Eosinophils are associated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes are important for the immunity of the body.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
