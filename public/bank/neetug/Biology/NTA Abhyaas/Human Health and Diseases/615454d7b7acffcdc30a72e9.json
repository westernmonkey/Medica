It requires two hosts: man and mosquito to complete its cycle. Sporozoites are infectious agents of malarial parasites. When a female mosquito bites the human, these enter the bloodstream. Inside the body these have an erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic cycle. When in the human body, the infectious agent undergoes many developmental stages (asexual reproduction). It also produces a toxin known as hemozoin inside the body and this is responsible for various symptoms like fever, chills, etc. When healthy mosquito bites such an infected human, these agents enter the mosquito's body and start its sexual reproduction which transforms into various forms and reside in the salivary gland. This healthy mosquito is now an infected one and if this again bites any human, the same cycle continues. Thus the pathogen cannot form a zygote in man because the sexual reproduction is completed in the mosquito's body.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
