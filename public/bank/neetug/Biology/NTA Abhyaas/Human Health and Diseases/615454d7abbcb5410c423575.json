From the virus's standpoint, macrophages are an ideal reservoir cell because they are long-lived, because HIV does not kill macrophages by direct lysis, as it does CD4+T cells, and because virus production by chronically infected macrophages tends to be relatively insensitive to a variety of antiretroviral agents. Besides hosting a significant virus reservoir, chronically infected macrophages and/or their brain counterparts, microglia, may contribute to pathogenesis through the chronic aberrant release of a variety of host and viral cytoactive factors and may be subject to chronic dysregulation through the aberrant expression of surface receptors.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
