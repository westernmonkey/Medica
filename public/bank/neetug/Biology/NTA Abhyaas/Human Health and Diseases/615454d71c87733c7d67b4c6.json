It is caused by round worm Wuchereria which is a digenetic worm (having two hosts - humans and mosquito). Sexual reproduction of filarial worm occurs in humans so for filariasis humans are primary hosts. Characteristic fever causing a feeling of cold, chills and rigor followed by increase in temperature and finally causing profuse sweating is a symptom of malaria which is caused by protozoan Plasmodium. It is a digenetic organism (having two hosts - humans and mosquito). Sexual reproduction of Plasmodium occurs in mosquito, hence mosquito is its primary host while asexual reproduction occurs in humans so humans are its secondary hosts. Vomiting, indigestion and diarrhea, gastrointestinal pain and discomfort is caused by Ascaris which is monogenetic round worm having only one host, humans. Abscess in the liver is caused by Entamoeba histolytica which is monogenetic protozoan having only one host, humans.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
