It is also known as the secondary immune response. When an individual's immune system comes in contact with the antigen for the first time, the immune system gets sensitized to this antigen, but the response is not much intensified. This is known as primary immune response. But, when the immune system comes in contact with the antigen subsequently, the immune response is highly intensified and massive, as the immune system was previously sensitized with this antigen.
