It is characterised by memory. This means when our body encounters a pathogen for the first time it produces a response called primary response which is of low intensity<strong>. Subsequent encounter with the same pathogen elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response</strong>. This is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the first encounter.&nbsp;The&nbsp; primary and secondary immune responses are carried out with the help of two special types of lymphocytes present in our blood, i.e., B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes.</p><p>The B-lymphocytes produce an army of proteins in response to&nbsp;pathogens into our blood to fight with them. These proteins are&nbsp;called antibodies. The T-cells themselves do not secrete antibodies but help B-cells to produce them.&nbsp;Different types of antibodies are produced in our body. IgA, IgM, IgE and&nbsp;IgG are some of them. Though IgG is the most common antibody formed by the memory cells,&nbsp;IgA- and IgE-expressing B-cells play an important role in the secondary immune response.</p>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
