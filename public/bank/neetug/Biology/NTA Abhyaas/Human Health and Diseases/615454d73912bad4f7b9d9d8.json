As these cells actively divide and grow they also starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. They secrete chemicals that promote the formation of new blood vessels for the cancer cells. This is called angiogenesis. Cells sloughed from such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This process is called metastasis", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
