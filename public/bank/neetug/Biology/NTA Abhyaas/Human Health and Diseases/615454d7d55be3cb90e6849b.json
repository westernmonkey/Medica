Presence of high amount of RER and GB indicates high production of protein. Guard cell is part of stomata which works by imbibing and releasing water, supporting in opening and closing of stomata. Mesophyll part of leaf in plant contains high amount of chlorophyll thus, involved in starch production than protein. Lastly, lymphocyte, a type of WBC is involved in making antibodies which is made of Protein (RER is involved) and GB helps in secreting out those produced antibodies.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d9b048a7bdf3428b79", "616025da7016fc46b1d4380c", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef137", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5f5", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b691c", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda80"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
