They have both vessels and tracheids in xylem for better conduction of water. Roots are modified into tap root adventitious roots, pneumatophores etc. to suit the desire climate. Sex organs are highly developed, sporophylls and organized into flowers and the flowers the highly coloured or modified to attract pollinators at different times and places. The flowers are made attractive to attract a variety of insects. Flowering plants (angiosperms) have the exploited insects, birds and several other animals as agem of pollination, fruits and seed dispersal. It is one major reason for present day dominance of flowering plants. Seed are more protected as they are enclosed inside a fruit. All these adaptations have made angiosperms most adaptive in diverse habitats.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
