They mainly found in marine habitat and display great variation in size and form. They may be simple branched, filamentous forms or profusely branched form called kelp. Chlorophyll a,c, carotenoids are present along with varying range of xanthophyll which gives the various shades of brown colour. Storage form of carbohydrates in them are laminarin or mannitol. The cellulosic cell wall of brown algae are covered with a gelatinous coating of algin which is a type of hydrocolloids. These group show asexual reproduction by biflagellate zoo spores with two unequal laterally attached flagella. The gametes involved in sexual reproduction are pyriform and bear two laterally attached flagella.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
