It is pteridophyte having vascular bundles. It has small leaves. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. Sporophylls form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones. Selaginella produces two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores and is hence heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. It is classified in the class Lycopsida with Lycopodium. The female gametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes for variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos take place within the female gametophytes.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
