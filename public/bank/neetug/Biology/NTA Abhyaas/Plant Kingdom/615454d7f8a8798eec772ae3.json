The cells are very long and broad and favour low temperature for growth. They attach themselves to the bed by a modified holdfast cell. <em>Spirogyra</em> on the other hand a free-living and form mass floating on surface of water bodies. They are generally found in freshwater region and named so due to their spiral form of chloroplast.<br /><br />Both these groups of organisms from filaments of chain of cells and are unbranched.
