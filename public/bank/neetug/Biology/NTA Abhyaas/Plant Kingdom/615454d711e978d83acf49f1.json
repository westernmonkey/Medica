In it, gametophytic stage is the dominant stage of life cycle having two stages - protonema and leafy stage. Protonema stage is also called as juvenile stage bearing buds from which the leafy stage is produced. It attached to the soil by rhizoids and bears the sex organs. The zygote formed by sexual reproduction develops into a sporophyte which forms on leafy stage bearing foot, seta and capsule. Sporophyte of mosses is more elaborate than that of liverworts.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
