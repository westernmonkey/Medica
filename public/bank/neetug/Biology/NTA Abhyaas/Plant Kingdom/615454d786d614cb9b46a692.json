Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known as heterosporous. The stems of gymnosperms are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum, and Sphagnum. While most algal genera are haplontic, some of them such as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic.
