They complete their vegetative phase on land but water is necessary for their reproductive phase <em>i.e</em>. for completion of the life cycle, so bryophytes are known as amphibians of the plant kingdom. Thallophytes have a plant body that is not clearly differentiated into roots, stem, and leaves. They do not have vascular tissue and hence are aquatic.<br />Pteridophytes are the most primitive vascular plants. They have developed vascular tissues and so they were the first vascular plants on land.<br />Tracheophyte includes all vascular plants - pteridophytes gymnosperms and angiosperms.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
