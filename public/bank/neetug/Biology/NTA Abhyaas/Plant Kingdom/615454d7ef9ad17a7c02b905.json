They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids, and xanthophylls. They vary in color of various shades of brown based on the amount of fucoxanthin and xanthophyll pigments present in them. The storage form of carbohydrates in them are laminarin or mannitol.<br /><br />Rhodophyceae is a group of algae, also called as red algae. They are majorly found in the marine habitat having a warmer climate. They are red in color due to a higher concentration of red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. They also have chlorophyll a and d. Food is stored as Floridian starch similar to amylopectin and glycogen. They generally reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation.<br /><br />Chlorophyceae, also known as green algae, have a plant body that may be unicellular, colonial, or filamentous. They appear grass green in colour due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The majority of them have storage bodies called pyrenoids in chloroplasts.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
