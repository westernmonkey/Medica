At this time, a pollen grain has two prothallial cell, a generative cell and tube cell. They form yellow clouds in pine forests. A pollen grain has two air sacs or wings for making it light.&nbsp;Part of the upper surface of the ovuliferous scale is peeled off along with the seed to form its wing. A female cone takes 26 months for reaching maturity. It further opens to release winged seeds that are dispersed by air. After falling on suitable soil, each seed gives rise to a new plant.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
