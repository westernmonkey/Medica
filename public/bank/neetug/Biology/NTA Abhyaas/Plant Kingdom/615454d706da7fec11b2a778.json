The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts.<br /><em>Volvox</em> shows anisogamous fusion i.e., fusion between one large, non motile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete.<br />During unfavourable conditions, the slime mould diferrentiates and forms fruiting bodies bearing spores at their tips.
