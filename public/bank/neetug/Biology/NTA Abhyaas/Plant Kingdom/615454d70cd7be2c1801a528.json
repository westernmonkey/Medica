Such type of spores are called heterosporous. The microspore gives rise to male plant and the megaspore forms the female plant. <br/><br/>Liverworts, type of bryophytes, usually grow in moist shady habitats and its plant body is called as thalloid. The sporophyte of liverworts is differentiated into foot, setae and capsule. Mosses are another type of bryophyte whose sporophyte stage has similar three parts like liverworts but more elaborated.<br/><br/>Gymnosperms are heterosporous and the spores are made in sporangia that are borne on sporophylls called stobili or cones. Male cones are the ones bearing the male gametes and female cone bears female gamete. In Pinus, both the cones are found on the same tree unlike in Cycas.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257c88583108671090ad", "6160257d7e62b4c3fe583fdd", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24d", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f61f", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaae"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
