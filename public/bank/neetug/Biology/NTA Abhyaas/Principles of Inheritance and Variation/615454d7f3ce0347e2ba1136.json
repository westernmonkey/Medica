Numbers of chromosomes are different in male and female individuals. Here, female shows homogameity (XX) while male shows hetrogameity (XO). It is clear that, all eggs (ova) bear an additional X-chromosome besides the autosomes while only 50% of the sperms bear X-chromosomes. In grasshopper, eggs fertilized by (A+X) type sperm become females while those fertilized by (A+O) type sperm become males. Therefore, sperm determines the sex of the offsprings.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>TURNER\u2019s SYNDROME:<br />Introduction: </strong>It was first described in 1938 by Turner. The disorder develops due to monosomy of sex chromosome. The disease is seen only in females. It is an allosomal chromosomal abnormality.<br /><strong>Cause: </strong>The disorder is due to monosomy. It appears due to fusion of abnormal egg (22+0) and a normal sperm (22+X) or a normal egg (22+X) and abnormal sperm (22+0).&nbsp;<br /><strong>Karyotype:</strong> [44 + XO]</div><div>&nbsp;</div>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
