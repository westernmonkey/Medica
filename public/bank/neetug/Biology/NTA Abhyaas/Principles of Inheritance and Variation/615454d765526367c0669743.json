This is transmitted from the father to son. In this pedigree it isn't so. Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder. Two parents not suffering from this disease can't produce diseased children. At least one parent should have a dominant allele means at least one parent should have the disease. This pedigree represents recessive condition. Cystic fibrosis is autosomal recessive and Colour-blindness is X linked recessive disease.
