Such individuals are sterile females who have rudimentary ovaries, undeveloped breasts, small uterus, puffy fingers, short stature (less than 5 feet), webbed neck, abnormal intelligence, cardiovascular abnormalities and hearing impairment.<br /><br />Klinefelter's syndrome is due to trisomy of sex (X) chromosomes. It is formed by the union of an abnormal XX egg and normal Y sperm or normal X egg and abnormal XY sperm. The individual has 47 chromosomes (44 + XXY). Such persons are sterile males (called feminised male) with undeveloped testes, mental retardation, female like sparse body hair, and knock knees, long limbs and with some female characteristics such as feminine pitched voice and enlarged breasts (gynaecomastia).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
