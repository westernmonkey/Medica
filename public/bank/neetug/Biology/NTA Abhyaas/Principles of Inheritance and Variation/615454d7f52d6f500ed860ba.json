The gene for normal vision is dominant. The normal gene and its recessive alleles are carried by X-chromosome. In female, colour blindness appears only when both the sex chromosomes carry the recessive gene (X<sup>c</sup>X<sup>c</sup>). The females have normal vision but function as carrier if a single recessive gene for colour blindness is present (XX<sup>c</sup>). However, in human males the defect appears in the presence of a single recessive gene (X<sup>c</sup>Y) because Y-chromosomes of males do not carry any gene for colour vision. Colour blindness, like other sex-linked trait, shows criss-cross inheritance (i.e., a male transmits his trait to his grandson through daughter, while a female transmits the traits to her grand-daughter through her son or it is transfer of trait from one sex to the offspring of the opposite sex).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
