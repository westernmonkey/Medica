The gene showed two alleles namely, B and b. BB homozygotes combination resulted in large starch grains as compared to that produced by bb homozygotes. After maturation, it was observed that round seeds were expressed by BB condition and bb expressed wrinkled type. Crossing of these resulted in the progeny giving round seeds like that of homozygotes but the starch grain size was intermediate to both homozygotes type. The seed shape followed the Law of Dominance given by Mendel but the starch grain synthesis deviated from it resulting in incomplete dominance.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
