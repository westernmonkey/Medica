When this gene is regulating the expression of more than one feature in an organism such phenomenon is called pleiotropy.<br /><br />In pea plant, starch synthesis is controlled by a single gene with two alleles B and b. The homozygous form BB produces large size starch grain and bb produces smaller size starch grain. Also, it was observed that this gene was controlling the shape of seed as well. On maturity, BB condition produced round shape seed and bb produced wrinkled seed. Single gene was effectively regulating the multiple phenotypic expression - seed shape and starch synthesis.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
