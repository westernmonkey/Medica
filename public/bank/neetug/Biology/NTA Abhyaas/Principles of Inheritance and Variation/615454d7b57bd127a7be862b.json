Down's syndrome is due to extra 21st chromosome, Turner's syndrome is caused in female due to lack of one of the X chromosome from the 23rd pair of XX. Klinefelter's syndrome is caused due to extra copy of the X chromosome in a male making the 23rd pair as XXY. Haemophilia, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia are disorders occurring due to change in a single gene of the chromosome rather than the whole chromosome undergoing change. These are also called as Mendelian disorders as they generally follow Mendel's laws of inheritance.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
