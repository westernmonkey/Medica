During reunion the broken pieces of the chromatids are exchanged, producing some nonparental or new combinations. Therefore, the linkage is rendered incomplete. The phenomenon of interchange of chromosome segments between two homologous chromosomes is called crossing over. Incomplete linkage is very common and has been studied in almost all the organisms.&nbsp;<br /><br />If two genes present at different gene loci are linked than during segregation more parental type is produced and recombinant types are less in number.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
