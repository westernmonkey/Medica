Mutation is change in the sequence of DNA segment. Mutation in the sequence of amino acids can result in formation of a new allele if the changes are simple and not on many bases. Multiple alleles combine in different combination to produce different phenotypes. Such variation in phenotypes occur due to the proteins encoded by the allele combination.<br/><br/>When traits are controlled by three or more genes, they are called polygenic traits and their inheritance is called as polygenic inheritance. Human skin colour is a classic example following polygenic inheritance as the skin colour is regulated by three pairs of gene. Polygenic inheritance is influenced by the environment as well and not just the polygenes.<br/><br/>Gene is a segment of DNA responsible for expression of proteins which in true expresses the character or feature represented by the gene. When this gene is regulating the expression of more than one feature in an organism such phenomenon is called pleiotropy.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
