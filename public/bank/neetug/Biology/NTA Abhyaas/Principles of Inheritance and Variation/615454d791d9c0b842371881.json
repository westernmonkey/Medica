An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female (queen or worker). And an unfertilized egg develops as a male (drone) by means of parthenogenesis. Thus genotypically male will be similar to females.This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes than that of a female. The females are diploid having 32 chromosomes and males are haploid, i.e., having 16 chromosomes. This is called as haplo-diploid sex-determination system and has special characteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis.<br />", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
