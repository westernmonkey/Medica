Down's syndrome is due to an extra chromosome number 21. The patient's cells have 3 copies of 21st chromosome (Trisomy 21) instead of homologous pair. It occurs due to failure of separation of homologous chromosomes or non-disjunction during meiosis (gamete formation). Symptoms of Down's syndrome:<br/><br/>(i) Patients show Mental retardation<br/><br/>(ii) Due to poor skeletal development, they have short stature and relatively small skull<br/><br/>(iii) Their face is typically flat with rounded flat nose<br/><br/>(iv) They have an open mouth, protruding tongue and a high arched palate.<br/><br/>(v) Most children show typical facial features with a fold of skin (epicanthal skin fold) over the inner corner of the eye. This results in downward slanting of eyelids.<br/><br/>(vi) They have flat hand with characteristic crease which runs all the way across the palm (Simian crease).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
