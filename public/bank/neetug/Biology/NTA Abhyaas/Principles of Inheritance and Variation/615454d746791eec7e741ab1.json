It occurs due to non-disjunction of chromosomes during anaphase I of meiosis. Since the patient has two chromosomes from the mother, the failure of disjunction happened in anaphase I or anaphase II of maternal meiosis.<br />Since the genes and alleles are exacty the same, the non-disjunction would have happened at anaphase II because the sister chromatids will have the same genomic content.
