And if it is dominant then it will be expressed in heterozygous and homozygous condition. <br/><br/>If the father is heterozygous for an autosomal dominant trait, the trait will be expressed. Since, the trait is dominant and only one allele is present there is a 50% chance that his children will have the autosomal trait. This is because, each child receives half of the genome from father and other half from mother. When the father produces gametic cells, 50% will have the autosomal trait and other 50% will not have it.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d1b586ca3d904b80e6", "616025d0eb47b6e940bd7489", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef149", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5d7", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6929", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda59"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
