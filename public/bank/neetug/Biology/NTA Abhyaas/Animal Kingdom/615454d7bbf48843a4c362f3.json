These include two third of all the animals on the earth. Majority of animals in this phylum are insects. 'Arthros' means joins and 'poda' means feet and hence these animals have jointed appendages. The body is divided into head, thorax and abdomen. These animals have proper organ systems, triploblastic body and are Eucoelomates. Their body is covered by exoskeleton made up of chitin.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258031f20d890d6b0ed5", "61602581a9a1d95459929d1d", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef153", "66d5854aa75f05ee8564f60b", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b6904", "68091fc93a10446a207fdaed"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
