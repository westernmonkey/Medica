These are digenic organisms as they require two hosts to complete their life- cycle. Snails are generally intermediate hosts. These belong to Phylum Platyhelminthes. The word Platy means flat. Hence these are commonly known as flat worms and thus their body is dorsoventrally flat. These organisms also show bilateral symmetry and are acoelomates which means they lack body cavity due to flat body This Phylum is evolved than earlier phyla due to presence of third germ layer i.e. Mesoderm. Hence these are regarded are Triploblastic organisms. The phenomenon of three germ layers began from this group and it continues till mammals. However these are special organisms because these are the only group which is Triploblastic and Acoelomates.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258031f20d890d6b0ed5", "61602581a9a1d95459929d1d", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef153", "66d5854aa75f05ee8564f60b", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b6904", "68091fc93a10446a207fdaed"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
