Non chordates include Phylum porifera to phylum Echinoderms. Chordates are further divided into Protochordates and Vertebrates. These animals are classified on the basis of when is notochord present and whether it forms vertebral column or not. Protochordates include Urochordates and Cephalochordates. Urochordates include those animals that show presence of notochord in the tail region. Examples: Tunicates. Cephalochordates show notochord throught out life and this is seen in Amphioxus. Frog and Humans are Vertebrates and in them notochord is replaced by vertebral column.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258031f20d890d6b0ed5", "61602581a9a1d95459929d1d", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef153", "66d5854aa75f05ee8564f60b", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b6904", "68091fc93a10446a207fdaed"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
