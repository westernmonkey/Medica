Thus group IV should be a sub group of group III which should be a sub group of II which should be a sub group of I. <br/><br/>In option i, Animals with three germ layers (Triploblastic) are present in all phyla from Platyhelminthes to Chordata. Animals having bilateral symmetry are present in all phyla from Platyhelminthes to Chordata except Echinodermata. Animals with no coelom (triploblastic + bilateral symmetry) are present in Phylum Platyheminthes. But members of Platyhelminthes don't have chitinous exoskeleton. This is seen in Arthropoda which is not included under Platyhelminthes.<br/><br/>In option ii, Animals with radial symmetry are present in Phylum Cnidaria, Phylum Ctenophora and Phylum Echinodermata. Animals with calcareous ossicles are present in Phylum Echinodermata. Animals with rasping organs called radula are present in Mollusca which is not included in Echinodermata.<br/><br/>In option iii, Animals with complete extracellular digestion are present in all phyla from Platyhelminthes to Chordata. Animals with chitinous exoskeleton are present in Arthropoda. Animals with three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings are Insects which are included under Arthropoda. Animals with book gills as their respiratory organs are crustacans which are not insects.<br/><br/>In option iv. Animals with notochord during embryonic stages are included in Phylum Chordata. Animals with well- defined jaws are present in Gnathostomata which is division under Phylum Chordata. Animals with 12 pairs of cranial nerves are amniotes includes in Class Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia included under division Gnathostomata. Animals which can maintain their internal temperature constant (homeotherms) are birds and mammals.
