Stomata consist of three parts i.e., cell pore, guard cells, and subsidiary cells. Guard cells are specialized cells that surround cell pore and helps the stomata in opening and closing. There are some epidermal cells present around the guard cells that are known as subsidiary cells. On the basis of the position of stomata, they are of the following types i.e. hypostomatic, epistomatic, amphistomatic, and sunken stomata. In amphistomatic, the stomata are present on both sides of the leaf.&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
