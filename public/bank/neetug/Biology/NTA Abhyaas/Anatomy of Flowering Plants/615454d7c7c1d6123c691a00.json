Meristem are a type of tissue found in such plants which can divide indefinitely. These are generally considered undifferentiated as they can give develop into all other tissues and organs of the plant. The meristematic tissues that appear early in plant life and help in formation of the plant body is called primary meristem. The apical and intercalary meristem are included in it. Meristematic tissue occurring between the mature regions of root and shoots of angiosperms are called secondary meristem. These generally form by dedifferentiation of the permanent tissues. The vascular cambium tissues found within the vascular tissues like xylem and phloem are secondary meristem which help in lateral growth of the plant helping in increasing the girth of the root or shoot.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
