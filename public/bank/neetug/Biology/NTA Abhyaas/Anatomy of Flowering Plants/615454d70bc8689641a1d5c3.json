Collenchyma layer is generally found below epidermis of the plant. They are either found in a patch manner or even distributed throughout. The cell wall of collenchyma tissue cells is thickened at corner due to higher deposition of cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose. The cells are generally spherical or polygonal in shape. This tissue provides mechanical support to the young stem and leaf. <br/><br/>The cross section of dicot plant stem has epidermis as the outermost layer and the region between pericycle and epidermis is called the cortex. The cortex of the stem is sub-divided in to regions and the section nearest to the epidermis is called hypodermis. The hypodermis (below epidermis) layer in dicot stem is made of collenchyma tissues compactly arranged. Whereas in the monocot stem, the hypodermis is made of sclerenchyma tissue.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
