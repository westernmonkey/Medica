Meristematic tissue occurring between the mature regions of root and shoots of angiosperms are called secondary meristem. These generally form by dedifferentiation of the permanent tissues. The vascular cambium tissues found within the vascular tissues like xylem and phloem are secondary meristem which help in lateral growth of the plant helping in increasing the girth of the stem. The cambium cells between the xylem and phloem is called as intra fascicular cambium. The new cambium cells that form towards the pith and mature into secondary xylem that is inner to the vascular cambium and the cells forming towards the periphery on the outer side is called secondary phloem. The younger cambium cells that will develop into xylem grow towards the central or inner side of the stem.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
