There are barrel-shaped parenchymatous cells found in the epidermis. Trichomes are absent in the monocot stem and below the epidermis, there is a layer of the hypodermal cell present. The ground tissue is undifferentiated in monocot stem which is made up of loosely arranged parenchyma cells. There is a vascular bundle which is found scattered in the ground tissue. Xylem is found on the inner side whereas phloem on the outer side and cambium is absent in monocot stem. So, the inner protoxylem is non-functional and remains water-filled. This water-filled cavity is called the lysigenous cavity or protoxylem cavity.&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
