This growth is a result of cell division in the cambium. When a woody dicot stem undergoes secondary growth the primary xylem (formed from the procambium) persists inside the stem in the centre of the axis without being damaged or changed during the growth. The secondary xylem is found covering the primary xylem and keeps growing in girth forming the bulk of stem. Due to this growth of the xylem during the secondary growth, the primary phloem and the older secondary phloem they get crushed towards the epidermis and form the wood.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025886537648b42b3b9d9", "61602587fcf5b78a8bab79b1", "64eb06d43118f713ecfef14c", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f654", "67fdff66378e1624ea7b6b02", "68091fc13a10446a207fda98"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
