The cells are first treated with enzymes pectinase and cellulase. These enzymes dissolve the cell wall, and as a result, naked protoplasts are produced.<br /><br />The naked protoplasts can be fused by electrofusion or chemofusion (through PEG or sodium nitrate). It results in hybrid protoplasts. Hybrid protoplasts are grown to develop new plants. These hybrids are called somatic hybrids, and the process is called somatic hybridization. The somatic hybrid may have a synkaryon (single fused nucleus) or heterokaryon (having two unfused nuclei). The hybrid protoplast is called cytoplasmic hybrid or cybrid, if one of the two nuclei of this gets degenerated.<br /><br />The first somatic hybrid was obtained by Carlson et. al. (1972) between <em>Nicotiana glauca</em> and <em>N. langsdorfi</em> (species of tobacco). The intergeneric somatic hybrids are pomato (potato x tomato), but unfortunately, pomato did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for its commercial utilization.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e0e6f38cc5cfbb365a", "616025e1390c779fbd6e193d", "64eb07043118f713ecfef32a", "66d5855ea75f05ee8564f6d1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
