In this technique, cattle are injected with hormones similar to FSH to enhance follicular development and this will result in superovulation. Due to this technique, more than one egg is ovulated. This animal is then mated with superior bull or sperms from such superior variety are inseminated into the female cattle's body. After fertilization, the eggs are recovered by non-surgical means and transferred to surrogate mothers. This is done so that the female cattle are again available for super ovulation. Thus this technique has been successfully used for the hybridization of cattle.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e0e6f38cc5cfbb365a", "616025e1390c779fbd6e193d", "64eb07043118f713ecfef32a", "66d5855ea75f05ee8564f6d1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
