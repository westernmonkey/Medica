Microbes like bacteria, algae or fungi are being grown on an industrial scale as a source of good protein. Microbes like <em>Spirulina</em> can be grown easily on materials like wastewater from potato processing plants (containing starch), straws, molasses, animal manure and even sewage, to be produced in large quantities and can serve as food rich in protein, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and vitamins. Incidentally, such utilisation also reduces environmental pollution.</p><p>It has been calculated that a 250kg cow produces 200g of protein per day. In the same period, 250g of a micro-organism like <em>Methylophilus methylotrophus</em>, because of its high rate of biomass production and growth, can be expected to produce 25 tonnes of protein.&nbsp;</p>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e0e6f38cc5cfbb365a", "616025e1390c779fbd6e193d", "64eb07043118f713ecfef32a", "66d5855ea75f05ee8564f6d1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
