These are mostly produces by the apical parts of roots and stems and from there move to different parts of plant as per need. <br/><br/>Cytokinin is a group of plant growth regulator that promotes cell division. These help in leaves production, chloroplast production. These chemicals have an impact on the cytokinesis process.<br/><br/>In tissue culture of plant explants, the medium is fed with high concentration of cytokinin and lower amount of auxin to induce shoot differentiation. High auxin concentration promotes root differentiation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e0e6f38cc5cfbb365a", "616025e1390c779fbd6e193d", "64eb07043118f713ecfef32a", "66d5855ea75f05ee8564f6d1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
