Breeding between animals of same breed is call inbreeding where as between animals of different breeds is called out breeding. The success rate of cross between male and female is improved using the technique of MOET (Multiple Ovulation Embryo Transfer Technology). Hormones having FSH like action are administered to the cow to induce follicular maturation and super ovulation i.e. release of multiple eggs in a single cycle. The animal is then either mated or artificially inseminated and the fertilized eggs are retrieved at the 8-32 celled stages and transferred into the surrogate mothers.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e0e6f38cc5cfbb365a", "616025e1390c779fbd6e193d", "64eb07043118f713ecfef32a", "66d5855ea75f05ee8564f6d1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
