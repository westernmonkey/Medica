Pusa Gaurav is a variety of Brassica (rapeseed mustard) which is resistant to aphids.<br />Semi-dwarf rice varieties were derived from IR-8, (developed at International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines) and Taichung Native-1 (from Taiwan). The derivatives were introduced in 1966. Later better-yielding semidwarf varieties Jaya and Ratna were developed in India.<br />The method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture is called micropropagation. Each of these plants will be genetically identical to the original plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are somaclones.<br />Pusa Sawani is a pest-resistant variety of okra (bhindi), which is resistant to shoot and fruit borers.<br />The capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell/explant is called totipotency.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e0e6f38cc5cfbb365a", "616025e1390c779fbd6e193d", "64eb07043118f713ecfef32a", "66d5855ea75f05ee8564f6d1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
