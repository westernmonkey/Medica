It is situated in the left side of abdomen region slightly above the stomach. It is considered as the 'blood bank' of the body. Histology of spleen shows presence of Red and White pulp. White pulp is associated with immune cells i.e. White blood cells. Red pulp consists of broken Red blood cells and also the breakdown products of Heamoglobin which is important as these gets metabolized to form bile pigments, urobilinogen, stercobilin etc. Hence Spleen is known as Graveyard of RBC. Red blood cells have a life span of about 120 days after which these die in the spleen. Splenic capillaries are smallest in diameter and thus when RBC's pass through them they die. Hence if Spleen is removed, this process will be hampered and also Haemoglobin metabolism will not take place.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
