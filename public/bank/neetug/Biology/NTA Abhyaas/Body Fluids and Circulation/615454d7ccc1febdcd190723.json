The liver also helps in destroying old and worn out RBCs. These cells contain the respiratory pigment haemglobin which acts as a buffer as it can bind to small amounts of acid in the blood, helping to remove that acid before it fluctuates the pH of blood. These RBCs also tend to aggregate thereby increasing the viscosity of blood.<br /><br />However the quantity of RBCs in blood is approximately 5.5 million per cubic mm of blood i.e. in one tiny droplet of blood.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
