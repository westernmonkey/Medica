This protein is genetically inherited where presence of protein is deemed as Rh+ and its absence as Rh-.<br/><br/>If a Rh- mother is impregnated with Rh+ father, there is a chance of Rh incompatibility as the baby will be Rh+. If the developing fetus is Rh+, the mother's blood will consider the Rh protein as foreign antigen and develop antibodies against it. Blood cells of mother will attack the baby as a defense mechanism which can be fatal. Such a condition resulting in death of baby is called erythroblastosis foetalis.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
