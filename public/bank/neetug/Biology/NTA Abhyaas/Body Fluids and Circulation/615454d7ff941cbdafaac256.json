It can occur in both sexes of any age but its occurrence increases with age.<br /><br />Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): It is often referred to as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle. In this condition, the lumen of arteries gradually becomes narrower due to the deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues.<br /><br />Heart failure: When the heart is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It leads to the congestion of the lungs (one of the main symptoms) because of which it is also termed as congestive heart failure.<br /><br />Cardiac arrest: When the heart stops beating.<br /><br />Heart attack: When the heart muscles are suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
