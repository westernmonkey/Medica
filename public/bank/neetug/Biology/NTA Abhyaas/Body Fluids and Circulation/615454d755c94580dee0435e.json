This is recorded by a machine known as Electrocardiograph. This is recorded using six chest leads and three limb leads. This graph shows many peaks which are designated by alphabets P to T. The three limb leads are Left wrist, Right wrist and Left ankle. This is the standard placement of leads. Right ankle is grounded as it acts to remove extra currents and is not a part of ECG readings. The three leads form the Eithoven triangle (imaginary triangle).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
