This involves contraction of heart i.e. systole and relaxation of heart i.e. diastole of both atrias and ventricles. Two prominent heart sounds are heard during each cardiac cycle. These are Lub-Dub and can be easily heard with the help of sthethoscope. The first heart sound is lub or S1 and this is produced due to closure of atrio-ventricular valves i.e. bicuspid and tricuspid valves and is heard at the beginning of ventricular systole. Second heart sound is dub or S2 and this is due to closure of semilunar valves and is heard at the end of ventricular systole.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
