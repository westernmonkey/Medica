Antigens are present on the surface of erythrocytes (RBC), whereas antibodies are present in blood plasma. For example, a person with blood group B has surface antigen B on RBC's and antibodies to antigen A in its plasma. Hence, when RBCs are donated, the transfer of antibodies does not take place. However, as the RBCs of the donor have a surface antigen, it should be ensured that the recipient's plasma should not contain antibodies against the antigen on red blood capsules of the donor. Otherwise, if transfusion is made between incompatible donor and recipient, the reaction between the antigens on the donor's RBCs and antibody in the recipient plasma will produce clot and blocked capillaries.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
