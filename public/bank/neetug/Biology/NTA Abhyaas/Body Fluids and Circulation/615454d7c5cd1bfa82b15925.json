This is recorded by a machine known as an electrocardiograph. This is recorded using six chest leads and three limb leads. This graph shows many peaks that are designated by alphabets P to T. P marks the beginning and T is the end of the graph. Heart activity begins with the help of sino atrial node and this is represented by a P wave. Hence P wave denotes atrial depolarization. QRS represents ventricular systole and the ending of this is represented by T wave.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ad89ee13bae06050dc", "616025aee31fe2dd3f1a3f16", "64eb06ec3118f713ecfef240", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d4", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6916", "68091fd43a10446a207fdb56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
