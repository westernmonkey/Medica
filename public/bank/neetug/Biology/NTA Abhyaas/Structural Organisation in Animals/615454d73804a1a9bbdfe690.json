These tissues have certain connecting links, which give structural as well as functional support called as junctions. There are three types:<br />1. Tight junctions: They are present between cells. They support to prevent any leaks of material which is not required across the tissue and also in a way keep cells separate.<br />2. Adhering junctions: As the name suggests, they do the job of adhesion between cells, keeping it together.<br />3. Gap junctions: They are found in epithelial tissue and provide transport of material, viz., ions transport, small molecules, water etc., between adjacent cells.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
