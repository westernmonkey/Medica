Tight junctions help to stop substances from leaking across a tissue, whereas adhering junctions perform cementing to keep neighboring cells together. Compound epithelium covers the dry surface of the skin as well as the moist surface of the buccal cavity, pharynx, and inner lining of ducts of glands.
