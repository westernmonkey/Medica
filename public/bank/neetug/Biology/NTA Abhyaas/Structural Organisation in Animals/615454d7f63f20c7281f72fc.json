Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to each other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils. Actin filaments are thinner as compared to the myosin filaments, hence are commonly called thin and thick filaments respectively.&nbsp;<br />The central part of anisotropic or A band where only thick or myosin filament is present and thin or actin filament is absent is called 'H' zone. In the middle of this zone a thin fibrous membrane 'M' line is present.&nbsp;In a resting state, the edges of thin filaments on either side of the thick filaments partially overlap the free ends of the thick filaments leaving the central part of the thick filaments.
