There are many minute column-like structures present in it namely the Haversian system. These contain layers of bone cells around a central canal called Haversian canal.  These columns are connected to each other by perforating channels- Volkmann's canal.<br/><br/>Cartilage is a type of connective tissue forming soft boy structures of nose tip, ear pinna. Nose tip contain hyaline cartilage whereas the ear pinna has elastic cartilage. <br/><br/>Simple cuboidal epithelium is found in the convoluted parts of nephron that help in water absorption. Ciliated epithelium is found in the inner walls of trachea and even in the fallopian tube of female reproductive system. <br/><br/>The abdominal wall of the body has skeletal muscles as there is voluntary control over the movement. Smooth muscles are found in the alimentary canal of the body.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
