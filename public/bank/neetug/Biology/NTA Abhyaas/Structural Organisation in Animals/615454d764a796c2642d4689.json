The female reproductive system of cockroach consists of two large ovaries, lying laterally in the 2<sup>nd</sup> - 6<sup>th </sup>abdominal segments. Thus ovaries are longer than testes. Males bear a pair of short, threadlike anal styles which are absent in females. In both sexes, the 10<sup>th</sup> segment bears a pair of jointed filamentous structures called anal cerci. A pair of spermatheca is present in the 6th segment of female cockroach which opens into the genital chamber. Their fertilized eggs are encased in capsules called oothecae.
