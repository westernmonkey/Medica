It is specifically loose connective tissue as it shows presence of matrix in which the cells and fibres are loosely arranged. It is the fat storing tissue. It is of two types: White and Brown adipose tissue. In white, there is a single large fat droplet in the cells surrounded by little cytoplasm. The brown fat has many small droplets of fat suspended in large amount of cytoplasm. Brown fat is present in new-born babies and hibernating mammals and it has large tendency to produce heat. The colour is brown due to presence of iron containing pigments and not due to muscle protein i.e. myoglobin.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
