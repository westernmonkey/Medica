Skeletal or striated muscles, smooth or unstriated muscles, and cardiac muscles. Unstriated muscles are so named because these muscles lack striations i.e. dark and light bands. Hence these are smooth muscles. These muscles are not under our control and hence are also known as involuntary muscles. These muscles are present lining the internal organs and hence are visceral muscles. These are under the control of the autonomic nervous system. The muscle fibres are fusiform shaped that taper at both the ends and are uninucleated. Cell junctions are seen in between the fibres.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
