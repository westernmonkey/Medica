Head bears compound eyes, mouthparts, and antennae. Thorax is divided into three parts: the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax. Three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings arise from the thorax. Each pair arises from each part of the thorax and thus these are named as prothorax, mesothoracic and metathoracic legs. The two pairs of wings are forewings and hindwings. Forewings arise from the mesothorax or junction of pro and mesothorax. Hence, these wings are known as mesothoracic wings. These are covered by a thick sheath known as tegmina. These being thick cannot be used for flying and hence are used to protect the delicate hind wings while walking. Hind wings are used in flight.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
