This tissue is further divided into three types: Loose connective tissue, dense connective tissue, and specialized connective tissue. Loose connective tissue shows a matrix with cells and fibers. These are areolar and adipose tissue. Dense connective tissues are tendons and ligaments. These are known as dense as fibers and cells are densely packed in the matrix. Specialized connective tissues are fluid connective tissues or supporting connective tissues. Fluid connective tissues are blood and lymph as these are fluid and thus fibres are absent. Supporting connective tissues include bone and cartilage as these have lacunae.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
