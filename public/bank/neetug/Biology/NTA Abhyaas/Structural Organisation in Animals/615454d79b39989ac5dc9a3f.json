It is divided into simple and compound epithelium on the basis of layers resting on the basement membrane. The simple epithelium consists of only one layer. This epithelium is further divided into various types depending on the shape of cells. These are squamous epithelium, cuboidal epithelium, columnar epithelium, ciliated epithelium and pseudostratified epithelium. Columnar epithelium consists of tall or pillar like cells in which length is more than the width and so nuclei appear to be located at the base of cells. This epithelium causes absorption and secretion and to increase the surface area this epithelium also shows the presence of microvilli. This is known as brush bordered epithelium. The columnar epithelium is found in the lining of stomach and intestine.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
