These tissues do not have fibres and thus collagen or elastin are also absent. Osteocytes are bone forming cells. These are present in a bone cavity called Lacunae that also has extensions known as canaliculi. Lamellae are concentric layers of compact bone surrounding the haversian canal in mammals. Striated fibres are unbranched and show striations. Basophils are Granulocytes. These are types of Leukocytes.

Histamine is a Vasodilator. Serotonin mainly acts as Vasoconstrictor while Heparin is an anticoagulant.
