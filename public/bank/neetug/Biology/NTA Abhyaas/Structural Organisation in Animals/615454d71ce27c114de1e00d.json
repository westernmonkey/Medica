The body is divisible into Head, Thorax and Abdomen. Head contains eyes, antennae and mouthparts. There are two pairs of eyes seen in cockroaches : Compound and simple eyes. Compound eyes contain small structures known as Ommatidia and each ommatidium has one lens. There are around 2000 ommatidium in each eye of cockroaches.This forms a Mosaic vision. This vision helps in forming many images of an object and thus helps in alertness of the insect and thus is more sensitive. Since ommatidia are very small structures the image which is formed is of less resolution.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
