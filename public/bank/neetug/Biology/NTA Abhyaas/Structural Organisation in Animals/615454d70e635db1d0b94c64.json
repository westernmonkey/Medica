The tissue always rests upon underlying connective tissue and are closely packed with each other so there is very little intercellular space. Due to absence/less of intercellular spaces, blood vessels, lymph vessels and capillaries are unable to pierce this tissue so blood circulation is absent in epithelium. Hence cells depend on their nutrients on underlying connective tissue. The cells of this tissue can divide throughout life with high regeneration capacity as they process the stem cells.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160258ce21aa4309019c961", "6160258bab021a64c66b3862", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef16e", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fa", "67fdff3d378e1624ea7b6926"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
