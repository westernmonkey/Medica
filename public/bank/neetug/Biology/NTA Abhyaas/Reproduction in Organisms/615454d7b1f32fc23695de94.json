The reproductive process is called as vegetative propagation as the non-reproductive parts/organs (leaf/stem/roots) are involved. Potato is a tuber stem modified for storage and it also supports reproduction by formation of small buds/sprouts on its surface called as 'eyes'.<br/><br/>Ginger is a modified stem called as rhizome which may grow at soil surface or underground. Rhizome contain nodes from which new roots and shoots develop, thus, supporting vegetative propagation. Bryophyllum is a plant group coming under the family Crassulaceae. These plants propagate by formation of buds on the edges of the leaf called leaf bud. These buds fall off and root wherever they land. Offsets are basically type of modified runner stem found in the aquatic plants like water hyacinth. These grow horizontal to the ground level and result in formation of new plantling at regular interval via vegetative propagation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c7d42f0cd3e73bce3f", "616025c6a10e96f8041f5a6a", "64eb06f13118f713ecfef278", "66d5854ea75f05ee8564f637", "67fdff59378e1624ea7b6a8a", "68091fc73a10446a207fdad9"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
