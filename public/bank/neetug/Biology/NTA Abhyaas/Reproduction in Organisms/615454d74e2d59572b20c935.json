In this type of regeneration, little or no cellular proliferation takes place during the regeneration process. A classic example of an organism that regenerates using this mechanism is the <em>Hydra</em>. When a <em>Hydra </em>is cut into two pieces, two <em>Hydra's</em> will be regenerated, both smaller than the parental <em>Hydra</em>. Once regeneration is completed, the two <em>Hydra </em>can continue to grow and reach the size of their original parent. Growth requires cellular proliferation but during the regenerative process very little cellular proliferation takes place.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c7d42f0cd3e73bce3f", "616025c6a10e96f8041f5a6a", "64eb06f13118f713ecfef278", "66d5854ea75f05ee8564f637", "67fdff59378e1624ea7b6a8a", "68091fc73a10446a207fdad9"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
