Sexual mode of reproduction is the reproductive process where two gametic cells fertilize or fuse to produce a zygote. In asexual reproduction, offspring is formed from a single parent without the formation of gametes. Sexual reproduction where gametes fuse to form a zygote is referred to as amphimixis.<br /><br />Vegetative propagules are the plant parts or organs that are involved in the process of reproduction even though their primary function is not it. The reproductive process is called vegetative propagation as the non-reproductive parts/organs (leaf/stem/roots) are involved. It is a type of asexual reproduction.<br /><br />In certain organisms, small buds are produced attached to the parent organism which grow and eventually separate to develop into new organism. This process is called budding and it is a type of asexual reproduction.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c7d42f0cd3e73bce3f", "616025c6a10e96f8041f5a6a", "64eb06f13118f713ecfef278", "66d5854ea75f05ee8564f637", "67fdff59378e1624ea7b6a8a", "68091fc73a10446a207fdad9"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
