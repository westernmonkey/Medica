These pores generally are present on the undersurface of the leaf but also found on upper surface in monocot plant leaves. <br/><br/>The activity of guard cells results in opening and closing of the stomata. The guard cells have a thickened cell wall on the inner of the pore. When the cells are at rest or flaccid, the pore remains closed that is stomata is closed and there is no movement of water and gases. When the guard cells absorb water via osmosis making the cell turgid. The outer cell wall bulges out and the inner thick cell wall takes a crescent shape opening the pore of stomata.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259dca641973971f3ca1", "6160259cfcb296ec6df680cf", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef140", "66d5854da75f05ee8564f62c", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b6907", "68091fc13a10446a207fda93"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
