Root pressure results in exudation and as well as guttation.<br /><br />Fluid emitted via the roots of the plants are referred to as exudates and the process is called as exudation.<br /><br />Loss of impure water from plant, generally from the margins of leaves is termed as guttation. The water contains a dilute solution of different organic and inorganic substances. Guttation occurs due to low rate of transpiration and more water absorption. This higher rate of absorption develops root pressure and pushes the excess water out of the specialized pores of veins called hydathodes. Guttation is a type of exudation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259dca641973971f3ca1", "6160259cfcb296ec6df680cf", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef140", "66d5854da75f05ee8564f62c", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b6907", "68091fc13a10446a207fda93"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
