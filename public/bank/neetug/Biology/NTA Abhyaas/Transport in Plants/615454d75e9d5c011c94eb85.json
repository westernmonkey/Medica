Movement of water among adjacent cells is by osmosis as observed in water moving in root cells and also from vascular bundle to ground tissue cells.<br/><br/>The process of uptake of water from soil into the root is mainly by osmosis due to difference in the water concentration in the root cell and soil.<br/><br/>Movement of water within the xylem element is by capillary action and cohesion action of the water than osmosis. Also, the movement is assisted by transpirational pull and diffusion.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259dca641973971f3ca1", "6160259cfcb296ec6df680cf", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef140", "66d5854da75f05ee8564f62c", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b6907", "68091fc13a10446a207fda93"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
