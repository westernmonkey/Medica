The operon holds the promoter, operator, and the structural genes which express to produce the necessary protein intron are not part of the operon. Lac operon is one of the most widely studied operon models. It was described by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod in <em>E. coli</em>. The sequence of the structural genes in lac operon is ZYA where the Z gene codes for the hydrolytic enzyme, beta-galactosidase. Allolactose turns it on by binding with repressor protein. It is an inducible operon and controls catabolic reactions. The RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and switches the production of proteins regarding the structural genes.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
