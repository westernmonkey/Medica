DNA is made of the long chain nucleotides which is made of the three components - deoxyribose sugar, N-base and the phosphate group. The DNA is a double helical structure having two anti-parallel strands of polynucleotide chains joined to each other by hydrogen bonding formed between the N-bases.  The backbone of the structure is constituted by the sugar-phosphate linked by the phosphodiester bond at 3'-OH group of the deoxyribose sugar. If this group is removed then phosphodiester bond will not form. As a result, polymerization of the molecule will not occur.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
