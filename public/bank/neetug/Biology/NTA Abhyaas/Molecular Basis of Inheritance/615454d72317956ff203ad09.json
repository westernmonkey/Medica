Considering that gene expression results in the formation of a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels.<br />In eukaryotes, the regulation of gene expression could be exerted at four levels.<br />i) Transcriptional level: Formation of the primary transcript.<br />ii) Processing level: Formation of primary transcript<br />iii) Transport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm.<br />iv) Translational level.<br />The genes in a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a set of functions. In eukaryotes, functionally related genes do not represent an operon but are present on different sites, chromosomes. Here structural gene is called split gene which is a mosaic of exons and introns, i.e., the base triplet \u2013 amino acid matching is not continous. The entire split gene is transcribed to form a continuous strip of mRNA. The removal of non \u2013 coding intronic part and fusion of exonic coding parts of RNA is called RNA splicing. About 50-90% of primary transcribed RNA is discarded during processing. The development and differentiation of embryo into adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of expression of several sets of genes.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
