Adenine and guanine are bases that have a double ring structure; cytosine, thymine and uracil are bases with a single ring structure.<br />\rII. An adenine nucleotide from DNA is the same as an adenine nucleotide from RNA; in DNA, adenine pairs with thymine and in RNA adenine pairs with uracil.<br />\rIII. The base pairing that occurs in a double DNA helix and when RNA is synthesised during transcription, it follows the rule that a purine pairs with a pyrimidine.<br />\rIV.
