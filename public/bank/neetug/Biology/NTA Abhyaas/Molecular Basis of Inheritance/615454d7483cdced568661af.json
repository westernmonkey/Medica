DNA is made of the long chain nucleotides which is made of the three components - deoxyribose sugar, N-base and the phosphate group. The DNA has negative charge due to the phosphate backbone which is negatively charged. In prokaryotes, the DNA structure is stabilized and held together by the positively charged proteins which neutralize the charge also. The region of DNA held with proteins in the prokaryotes is called as nucleoid.<br /><br />Histone proteins are found to hold the DNA and help in it folding in the eukaryotic cells.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
