Adenine and guanine are bases that have a double ring structure; cytosine, thymine and uracil are based with a single ring structure.<br />\rII. An adenine nucleotide from DNA is the same as an adenine nucleotide from RNA; DNA adenine pairs with uracil and RNA adenine pairs with thymine.<br />\rIII. The base pairing that occurs in a double DNA helix and when RNA is synthesised during transcription follows the rule that a purine pairs with a pyrimidine.<br />\rIV. The two polynucleotides on a DNA molecule run in opposite directions so that the double helix formed has two strands that are parallel to each other.", "image": null}, "options": [{"id": "vWp5o", "text": "I, II and III only", "image": null, "isCorrect": false}, {"id": "bJ6sW", "text": "I, II and IV only", "image": null, "isCorrect": false}, {"id": "1I6a7", "text": "II, III and IV only", "image": null, "isCorrect": false}, {"id": "iE0Xv", "text": "I, III and IV only", "image": null, "isCorrect": true}], "correctValue": null, "solution": {"text": "Adenine and Guanine are purines which has two-ring structure whereas Thymine, Uracil and cytosine are pyrimidines having single ring structure.
