There are evidences to suggest that essential life processes, such as metabolism, translation, splicing etc. evolved around RNA. RNA used to act as a genetic material as well as a catalyst. There are some important biochemical reactions in living systems that are catalysed by RNA catalyst (ribozyme) and not by protein enzymes e.g., Ribonuclease P (Cleavage), Snurps (Splicing), Peptidyl transferase&nbsp; (peptide bond formation). But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and hence unstable. Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA with chemical modifications that make it more stable. DNA being double stranded and having complementary strand further resists changes by evolving a process of repair. RNA is adapter, structural molecule and in some cases catalytic. From above discussion it is very much clear both RNA and DNA can function as genetic material, but DNA being stable is preferred for storage of genetic material. For the transmission of genetic information RNA is better material.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
