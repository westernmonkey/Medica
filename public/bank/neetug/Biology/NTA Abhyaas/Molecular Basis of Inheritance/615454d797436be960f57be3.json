When these bacteria are grown on culture some produced the smooth colonies (S) and other produced rough colonies (R). The mice infected with S strain dies and those with R did not. After heat killing the bacteria he observed that these heat killed S strain did not cause any disease. But when he injected the mixture of heat killed S strain and R strain the mice died, and also he could recover living S strain from the dead mice. From this he concluded that there is some transforming principle which helped R starin to become virulent and cause death.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
