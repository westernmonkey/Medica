In eukaryotes, the gene contains extra sequences that do not code for any protein. In these organisms, transcription of DNA produces pre-mRNA. These pre-mRNA transcripts often contain regions, called introns, which are intervening sequences which must be removed prior to translation by the process of splicing. The regions of RNA that code for a protein are called exons. Introns are intervening sequences within a pre-mRNA molecule that do not code for any protein and are removed during RNA processing by a spliceosome.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
