Transcription is the process of making mRNA from the DNA and this mRNA is translated into a long chain polypeptide with help of ribosome and tRNA.<br /><br />Repressor protein is part of the gene expression regulation where it inhibits the expression of gene by attaching to the operator part of the regulatory unit.<br /><br />The functional unit of DNA having a group of genes regulated by a single promoter is termed as operon. Operon holds the promoter, operator and the structural genes which express to produce the necessary protein. Intron is not part of the operon and it gets removed during splicing mechanism. Lac operon is one of the most widely studied operon model.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
