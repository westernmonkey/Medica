One of the enzymes is peptidyl transferase which forms peptide bonds between amino acids in found on the 50S subunit (larger subunit) of ribosome. It acts a ribozyme. <br/><br/>The process of protein synthesis takes place over the ribosomes. Thus, they are also called protein factories having two unequal parts called subunits. One large subunit and another smaller subunit. A groove is present in the large subunit which pushes the newly formed protein chain out and protects from cellular enzymes.<br/><br/>During the protein synthesis process the small and large subunits come together where the smaller subunit fits over the larger one like a cap but leaves a tunnel for mRNA.<br/><br/>There are three binding sites on ribosomes that bind to the tRNA- P, A and E. The two ribosomal units jointly contribute the P-site (peptidyl transfer or donor site). The acceptor site or amino-acyl site (A-site) is located on the larger subunit and the E-site is found to be facing the tunnel site on larger subunit", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025cc3a61b04cbfa67cc0", "616025cd244bdfb6de491d0a", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef156", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f61b", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ab", "68091fbb3a10446a207fda50"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
