Of late, the balance has been disrupted due to enhancement of ozone degradation by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs find wide use as refrigerants. CFCs discharged in the lower part of the atmosphere move upwards and reach the stratosphere. In the stratosphere, UV rays act on them releasing Cl atoms. Cl degrades ozone, releasing molecular oxygen. With these atoms acting merely as catalysts, Cl atoms are not consumed in the reaction. Hence, whatever CFCs are added to the stratosphere, they have permanent and continuing effects on ozone levels.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ebc57af9e809d55c7b", "616025ea2711a65bdd491026", "64eb06ee3118f713ecfef256", "66d5854ea75f05ee8564f632", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b69a5"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
