We have got used to associating loud sounds with pleasure and entertainment, not realising that noise causes psychological and physiological disorders in humans. Brief exposure to extremely high sound level, 150 dB or more generated by taking off of a jet plane or rocket, may damage eardrums. Thus permanently impairing hearing ability. Even chronic exposure to a relatively lower noise level of cities may permanently damage the hearing abilities of humans. Noise also causes sleeplessness, increased heartbeat, altered breathing pattern, thus considerably stressing humans. Noise pollution causes anxiety, stress and irritability. Adrenaline hormone is released when the body is under stress. So, noise pollution leads to the secretion of adrenaline hormone, which provides the added energy to the body to deal with the stressful situation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025ebc57af9e809d55c7b", "616025ea2711a65bdd491026", "64eb06ee3118f713ecfef256", "66d5854ea75f05ee8564f632", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b69a5"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
