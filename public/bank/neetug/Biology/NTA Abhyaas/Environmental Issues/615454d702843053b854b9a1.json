Eutrophication occurs naturally over centuries as lakes age and is filled in with sediments. However, human activities have accelerated the rate and extent of eutrophication through both point-source discharges and nonpoint loadings of limiting nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, into aquatic ecosystems (i.e., cultural eutrophication), with dramatic consequences for drinking water sources, fisheries, and recreational water bodies. Eutrophication is one of the causes of the deterioration of water quality.
