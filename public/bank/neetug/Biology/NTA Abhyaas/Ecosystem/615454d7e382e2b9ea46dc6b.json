It is divided into gross and net primary productivity. The rate of production of organic matter by plants through photosynthesis is called gross primary productivity and the net primary productivity is the availability of biomass for consumption by heterotrophs. The rate at which the new organic matter is produced by consumers is called secondary productivity.
