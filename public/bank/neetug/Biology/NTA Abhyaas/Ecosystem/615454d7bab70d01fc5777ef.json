From the total carbon content in the biosphere, 71% of it is found dissolved in oceans as oceans absorb a lot of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis by phytoplankton. The oceanic reservoir regulates the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere via absorption and utilization. From the total carbon available to the organisms, some amount of the fixed carbon gets lost as sediments forming rocks and removed from circulation. Decomposers contribute carbon substantially by their activity of processing waste and dead organic matter.<br /><br />It is found that carbon constitutes nearly 49% of the dry weight of an organism which is next to water which is approximately 70%.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
