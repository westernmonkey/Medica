Thus, lower amount of energy is transferred to succeeding trophic level in a food chain. Organisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level for their energy demands.<br /><br />The dead and decaying organic content are broken down to inorganic substances by the process called decomposition. It is brought about by decomposers. Producers and decomposers help in maintaining the food chain.<br /><br />Removal of tigers from an area will result in decreased growth of vegetation of that area as the increased population of deer will consume more vegetation. Sparrow in a food chain can exist at two different trophic levels, while feeding on grains it occupies second trophic level, while feeding on worms they occupy third trophic level.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
