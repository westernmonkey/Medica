These are also called as biogeochemical cycles as there is involvement of biotic and abiotic factors and chemical reactions. There are many important cycles which help in maintaining the biosphere like carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle etc.<br /><br />In a typical food chain, the energy that is transferred from one trophic level to the next is always unidirectional and never forms a cyclical pattern. The main source of energy is the sun (solar energy/free energy), which is used by producers to make food and then it is consumed by consumers and so forth. The energy is never given back to the sun.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
