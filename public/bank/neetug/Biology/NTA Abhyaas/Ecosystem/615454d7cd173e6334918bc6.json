During ecological succession, one of the intermediate stages that develops is called the seral community. It gets replaced by a successive community during the succession process.<br /><br />The phosphorus cycle is considered as an imperfect cycle as the phosphorus that originates from a source does not go back to it. Lindemann proposed the Ten Percent Law for energy transfer in an ecosystem. Detritus food chain starts with dead organic matter where the organic matter is decomposed to its inorganic content and made available for the producers in the ecosystem.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
