These are also called as biogeochemical cycles as there is involvement of biotic and abiotic factors and chemical reactions. There are many important cycles which help in maintaining the biosphere like carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle etc. <br/><br/>Phosphorus is important for the biological membranes and nucleic acids. Also, it is important part of the energy molecule ATP. The natural reservoir of phosphorus is rock and also, phosphorus is released during the breakdown of waste products like guano deposits of birds and bats, and dead organisms by the decomposers like phosphate solubilizing bacteria. These form a part in the phosphorus cycle.<br/><br/>Lithosphere is considered as reservoir for sulfur and phosphorus.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
