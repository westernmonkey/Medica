They secrete digestive enzymes over the fragmented detritus. The enzymes degrade complex organic compounds into simple inorganic substances.<br />D) Humification. It is the process of decomposition of detritus to form humus. Humus is a dark-coloured, amorphous, more or less decomposed organic matter rich in cellulose, lignin, tannins, resin, etc. and is highly resistant against microbial action. It undergoes decomposition at an extremely slow rate. Humus is slightly acidic, colloidal, and functions as a reservoir of nutrients.</p><p>E) Mineralization. It is the release of inorganic substances by saprophytic microbes (e.g.. CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, minerals) from organic matter or humus during the process of decomposition. They are formed along with simple and soluble organic substances when digestive enzymes are poured over organic matter by saprotrophic microbes.</p>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
