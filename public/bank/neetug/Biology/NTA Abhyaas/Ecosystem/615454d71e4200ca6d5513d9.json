These organic contents are broken down to inorganic substances by the process called decomposition. It is brought about by decomposers. Decomposition is a mainly an oxygen dependent process and its rate is dependent on chemical composition and climatic factors. Temperature and moisture play an important role in rate of decomposition. Enough supply of oxygen and proper moisture accelerates the decomposition process. If the detritus contains lignin chitin, tannins and cellulose , the decomposition rate decreases.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f47a4fd69d9d3cdeb4", "616025f57988d9bdbbe02f3e", "64eb06ff3118f713ecfef301", "66d58551a75f05ee8564f650", "67fdff49378e1624ea7b69ae", "68091fc63a10446a207fdacb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
