These form the secondary consumers present in the third trophic level and are preceded by the herbivore in the food chain. The rate of assimilation of food energy by consumers is called secondary productivity and this energy is available to carnivores as they are the consumers.<br /><br />Total production of organic matter is called gross primary productivity and the energy left after utilization of producers is termed net primary productivity.
