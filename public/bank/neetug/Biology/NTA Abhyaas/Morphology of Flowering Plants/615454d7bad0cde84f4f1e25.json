For classification of angiosperms, the floral characters are preferred over the vegetative characters because they are less affected by the external environment and therefore show fewer variations as compared to the vegetative traits of the plant. One more reason for their preference is that the flowers are easy to be carried and greatly vary from each other, which makes the classification easier.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025836a44c4d339a09c6a", "616025856b27bf5d90dc8ac8", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef146", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f623", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a15", "68091fc53a10446a207fdabb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
