Leaf base is a junction between the leaf and stem and in monocotyledons, it forms a sheath covering the stem completely or partially. In some leguminous plants, it swells up which is called a pulvinus. Petiole helps to hold the leaf blade allowing it to flutter in wind. The leaf blade is extended green part consisting of veins and veinlets which provide rigidity as well as transport food, water and minerals.&nbsp;In monocots, leaf base expands into a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025836a44c4d339a09c6a", "616025856b27bf5d90dc8ac8", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef146", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f623", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a15", "68091fc53a10446a207fdabb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
