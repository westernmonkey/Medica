The cells of this region are newly formed cells which lose the power of division. They elongate rapidly. This increases the length of the root. The external cells possess the power of absorption of water and minerals salts from the soil. The root hair zone represents the zone of differentiation or maturation because different types of primary tissues differentiate or mature in this region. Some of the outer cells of this zone give rise to lateral tubular outgrowths called root hairs.<br />Maize and sugarcane have stilt roots.
