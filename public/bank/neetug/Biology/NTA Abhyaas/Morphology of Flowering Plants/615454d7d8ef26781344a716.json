It is characteristic feature of angiosperm.<br /><br />The flowers are termed pedicellate if they possess stalks and sessile if they lack them. The flower may be described as complete if it bears all the floral parts and incomplete, when one or more floral parts are absent. Flowers are called bisexual if they bear both androecium and gynoecium. The unisexual flowers have either androecium or gynoecium. The unisexual flowers may be male flowers or female flowers. The male flower are also called staminate flowers as they have stamens only.<br /><br />The female flowers have only the carpels and hence called pistillate flowers.
