While the ovary in the flowering plant develops into a fruit after fertilization. Fruit is a characteristic feature found in flowering plants.  Fruit formed from a group of flowers or inflorescence is called as multiple fruit or composite fruit. Each flower of the inflorescence produces a fruit but all join/fuse into a single mass. Example pineapple and mulberry.<br/><br/>Many a times the bulk of the fruit that is developing is not derived from the ovary but from other floral parts. Such fruits are called as false fruit, pseudo-fruits or accessory fruits. <br/><br/>In apple and pear, the thalamus or floral tube develops around the pericarp producing the bulk of the edible part. Pineapple and mulberry fruits are derived from receptacle of the flower than wholly from the ovary.<br/><br/>In the development of fruit for cashew, the pedicel forms the major bulk of the fruit than ovary.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025836a44c4d339a09c6a", "616025856b27bf5d90dc8ac8", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef146", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f623", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a15", "68091fc53a10446a207fdabb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
