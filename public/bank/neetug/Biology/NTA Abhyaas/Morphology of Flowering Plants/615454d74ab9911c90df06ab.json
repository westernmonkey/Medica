Each stamen has two parts anther and a stalk (filament). The stamens of the flower may be found united among themselves or with the other floral members such as the petals and sepals. When the stamens are found attached to the perianth like in the flowers of Lily they are known as epiphyllous and when they are found attached to the petals like in flowers of brinjal they are known as epipetalous. The stamens are known as episepalous when they are attached to the sepals.
