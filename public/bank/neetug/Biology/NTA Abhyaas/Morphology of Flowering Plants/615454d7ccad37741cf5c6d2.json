The ovary in such flowers is said to be superior, e.g., mustard, china rose and brinjal. In epigynous flowers, the margin of the thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused with it, the other parts of the flower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is said to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber. There may be a variation in the length of filaments within a flower, as in Salvia and mustard. Flowers are termed syncarpous when carpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. In parietal placentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or on peripheral part. The ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two-chambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard and argemone.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025836a44c4d339a09c6a", "616025856b27bf5d90dc8ac8", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef146", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f623", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a15", "68091fc53a10446a207fdabb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
