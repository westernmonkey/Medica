If there is only one bundle of stamens it is called monadelphy. This is commonly seen in Hibiscus. If there are two bundles of stamens it is called diadelphy. This is commonly seen in gram and pea. If there are more than two bundles of stamens it is called polyadelphy. This is commonly seen in Citrus and castor. In Cucurbita, anthers as well as filaments of stamens are united through their whole length. This is called synandry. Salvia has lever mechanism with variable length of filaments which helps in pollination by insects.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025836a44c4d339a09c6a", "616025856b27bf5d90dc8ac8", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef146", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f623", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a15", "68091fc53a10446a207fdabb"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
