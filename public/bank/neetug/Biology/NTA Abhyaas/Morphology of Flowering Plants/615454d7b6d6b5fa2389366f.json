It majorly consists of the leaf base, petiole, and the leaf lamina. Sometimes the swollen leaf base, called pulvinus, is seen in leguminous plants. The leaf generally emerges from the node of the stem where it forms an axil through which an axillary bud emerges. This axillary bud further develops into a branch. The leaf lamina serves as the stage for harvesting light for photosynthesis.
