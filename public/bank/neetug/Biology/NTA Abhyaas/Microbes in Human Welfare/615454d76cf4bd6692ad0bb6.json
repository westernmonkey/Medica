Both benefit from each other. In it, the fungus colonises the root system of the host plant either intra- or extra- cellularly. The fungal group is known to absorb phosphorus from soil and pass it to the host plant. Such associations also provide other benefits like resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance to salinity and drought. <br/><br/>The movement and exchange of organic and inorganic matter between living and non-living component in a cyclical manner refers to nutrient cycle. These are also called as biogeochemical cycles as there is involvement of biotic and abiotic factors and chemical reactions. There are many important cycles which help in maintaining the biosphere like carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle etc.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025dc1d4313b4e41c98ba", "616025de070db18dfc04073b", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef175", "66d58565a75f05ee8564f70b", "68091fc03a10446a207fda89"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
