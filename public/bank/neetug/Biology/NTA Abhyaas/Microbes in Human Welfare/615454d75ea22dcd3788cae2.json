The chemical fertilisers are being overused, and there is a growing insistence to switch to organic farming and use bio-fertilisers.<br /><br />Some bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic form, which is used by the plant as a nutrient. Other bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in the soil, such as <i>Azospirillum</i> and <i>Azotobacter</i>.<br /><br />Baculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods. The majority of baculoviruses used as biological control agents are from the genus <i>Nucleopolyhedrovirus</i>. These viruses are excellent candidates for species-specific, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications. They have been shown to have no negative impacts on plants, mammals, birds, dishes or even non-target insects. This is especially desirable when beneficial insects are being conserved to aid in an overall integrated pest management programme or when an ecologically sensitive area is being treated.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025dc1d4313b4e41c98ba", "616025de070db18dfc04073b", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef175", "66d58565a75f05ee8564f70b", "68091fc03a10446a207fda89"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
