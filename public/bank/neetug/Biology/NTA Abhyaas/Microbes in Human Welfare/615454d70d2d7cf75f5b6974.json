Both benefit from each other. In it, the fungus colonises the root system of the host plant either intracellularly or extracellularly. The fungal group is known to absorb phosphorus from soil and pass it to the host plant. Such associations also provide other benefits like resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance to salinity and drought.
