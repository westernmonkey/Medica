Beverages produced without distillation are wine and rum whereas those produced by distillation of the fermented broth are whisky, brandy and rum. The Swiss cheese has large holes in it which are due to large amount of CO2 produced by bacteria Propionibacterium sharmanii. Certain anerobically growing bacteria  produce large amount of methane along with carbon dioxide and hydrogen. One such bacterium is Methanobacterium and they collectively are  called methanogens. Microbes are found almost everywhere and even exist at sites where no other living organism can possibly survive.
