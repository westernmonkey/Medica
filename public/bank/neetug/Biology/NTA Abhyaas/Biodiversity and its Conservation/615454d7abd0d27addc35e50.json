All the varieties of organisms come under biodiversity. India, a tropical country, is considered one of the richest w.r.t. biodiversity as it is many climatic regions. Even though the landmass is just 2.4% of the earth, 8.1% of the total global species diversity is observed in India. Robert May, who was the CSO of UK govt., gave estimates on global species diversity and only 22 per cent of the total species have been recorded and 78% is unknown. Human activities have pushed many species to the brink of extinction. As a metaphor we can say that before we can completely catalogue the stocked books the biological library is burning. A large fraction of species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
