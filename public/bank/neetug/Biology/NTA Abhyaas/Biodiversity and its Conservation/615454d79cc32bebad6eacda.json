In other words, the population is not showing much change or variation and is able to withstand any hardships or changes in the environment. A stable community is not affected by invasion of other organisms including alien species. It resists loss of biodiversity.<br/><br/>David Tilman is an American ecologist whose work with outdoor plots in study of ecosystem led to the observation that in an area with more variety of species showed less variation in total biomass. His experiments showed that increased diversity contributed to higher productivity. His study helped in better understanding the role of species diversity in ecosystem stability.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
