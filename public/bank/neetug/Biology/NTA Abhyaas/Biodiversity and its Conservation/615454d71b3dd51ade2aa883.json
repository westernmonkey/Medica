In plants, this could be by freezing cuts from the plant or stocking the seeds. In animals, this is by the freezing of sperm and eggs in zoological freezers until further need. With corals, fragments are taken, which are stored in water tanks under controlled conditions. Plant genetic material in a 'gene bank' is preserved at -196 \u00b0C in liquid nitrogen as mature seed (dry). In plants, it is possible to unfreeze the material and propagate it.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
