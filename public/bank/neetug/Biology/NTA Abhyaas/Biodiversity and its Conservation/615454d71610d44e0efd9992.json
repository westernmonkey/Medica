National parks are reserved for betterment of wild life. Cultivation, grazing, forestry and habitat manipulations are not allowed. Sanctuaries are tracts of land with or without lake where wild life can take refuge. Harvesting of timber, collection of forest products, tilling of land, private ownership of land etc., are allowed. Biosphere reserves are multipurpose protected area which are meant for preserving genetic diversity in representative ecosystems of various national biomass and unique biological communities by protecting wild life, traditional life style of tribals and domesticated plant/animal genetic resources. Each biosphere reserve has 3 zones - (i)&nbsp; Natural zone - where no human activity is allowed, (ii)&nbsp; Buffer zone - limited human activity is allowed like education, research, (iii)&nbsp; Transition zone - has different parts like agriculture, tourism, and restoration regions.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
