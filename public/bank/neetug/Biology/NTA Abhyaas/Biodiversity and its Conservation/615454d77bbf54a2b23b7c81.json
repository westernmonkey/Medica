There are three different types of biodiversity patterns seen most commonly - genetic, species and ecological. <em>Rauwolfia vomitoria </em>growing in different regions of Himalayas has different potency and concentration of reserpine. This is an example of genetic diversity. When we compare the Eastern and Western Ghats we find that more species variations at the Western Ghats, this is species diversity. Ecological diversity can been seen in terms that the India has more ecosystem diversity than Norway due to the presence of deserts, rain forests, wetlands, etc.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
