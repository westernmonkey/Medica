All the varieties of organisms come under biodiversity. German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt made the observation regarding the relationship between species richness and the area of the habitat. As per his observation, species richness increased with increasing area of habitat up to a limit. When plotted in a graph, this relationship forms a rectangular hyperbola. On a log scale, the relationship is a straight line.<br/><br/>Tropical forests are very rich with vegetation and when we consider different continents, the area is very large. Species number over a vast area increases quite fast than explores area resulting in a steep slope giving a higher value. If slope of line is steep then it means that the slope will make smaller angle with the x- axis. The slope for mammals spread over different continent has been observed to be ~1.15.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
