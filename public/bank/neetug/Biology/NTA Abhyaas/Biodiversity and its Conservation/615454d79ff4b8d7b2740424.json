Initially, 25 biodiversity hotspots were identified but subsequently, nine more have been added to the list, bringing the total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world to 34.<br />These hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss. Three of these hotspots \u2013 Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma, and Himalaya \u2013 cover our country\u2019s exceptionally high biodiversity regions. Although all the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than 2% of the earth\u2019s land area, the number of species they collectively&nbsp;harbour is extremely high and strict protection of these hotspots could reduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30%.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
