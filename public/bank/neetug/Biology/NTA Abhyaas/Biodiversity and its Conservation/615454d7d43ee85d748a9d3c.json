All the varieties of organisms come under biodiversity. India, a tropical country, is considered one of the richest w.r.t. biodiversity as it is many climatic regions. Even though the land mass is just 2.4% of Earth, 8.1% of the total global species diversity is observed in India.  Robert May, who was the CSO of UK govt., gave estimates on global species diversity and if we are to consider it then only 22 percent of the total species have been recorded and 78% is unknown. Human activities have pushed many species to the brink of extinction.
