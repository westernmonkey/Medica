All the varieties of organisms come under biodiversity. Ecologist say that without any doubt there is decline in the biological wealth which is more rapid due to the activities of us humans. Basically, it is a way to measure the differences and variations among the organisms at genetic, species and ecological level. Biodiversity plays a very important role in maintaining species richness and stability of the ecosystem. Loss in the biodiversity will eventually result in decreased plant production and reduce the resistance of the flora-fauna to environmental change. Biodiversity loss will also bring about high rate of changes in ecosystem processes like plant productivity, pest and diseases cycles.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
