These can be plants or animals or pathogens. When introduced these may cause environmental harm or also affect human health. One such example is the introduction of Nile perch in Lake Victoria. Nile perch is a fish with economic importance but it was seen that it is becoming extinct due to lack of food. Thus these were introduced in different lakes one of them being Lake Victoria in East Africa. This resulted in an increase in population of Nile perch but affected the original variety that existed in that lake i.e. cichlids fishes couldn't survive because of these alien species.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025f1471a25fb7be4daa7", "616025f2e905bdc7d82bbba9", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15e", "66d58552a75f05ee8564f65e", "67fdff52378e1624ea7b6a2a", "68091fdf3a10446a207fdbc1"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
