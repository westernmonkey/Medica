The Henle\u2019s loop and vasa recta play a significant role in this. The flow of filtrate in the two limbs of Henle\u2019s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a counter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta is&nbsp;also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle\u2019s loop and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e., from 300 mOsmolL\u20131 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL\u20131 in the inner medulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is transported by the ascending limb of Henle\u2019s loop which is exchanged with the descending limb of vasa recta. NaCl is returned to the interstitium by the ascending portion of vasa recta. Similarly, small amounts of urea enter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle\u2019s loop which is transported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above described transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement of Henle\u2019s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b5c4bf8e454bdf9d87", "616025b625f0a602af9671e7", "64eb06ef3118f713ecfef261", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d1", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b69a1", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda6c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
