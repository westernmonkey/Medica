Dialysis may be necessary in patients with acute kidney failure to bridge the time gap required for treating the fundamental causes and as a holding measure in patients with irreversible end stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 until transplantation is performed. Sometimes Dialysis is the only supportive measure in patients with end stage CKD when transplantation is not possible.<br />In this process, the blood is drained from a convenient artery and an anti-coagulant like heparin is added to prevent clotting of blood and the cleared blood is pumped back to the body through a vein after adding anti-heparin to it. Dialysis treatment replaces only some of the kidney functions like diffusion (waste removal) and ultrafiltration (fluid removal). Thus Dialysis is an imperfect treatment to replace kidney function because it does not correct the endocrine functions of the kidney.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b5c4bf8e454bdf9d87", "616025b625f0a602af9671e7", "64eb06ef3118f713ecfef261", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d1", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b69a1", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda6c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
