Each kidney contains around one million nephrons that take part in the formation of urine and thus these are regarded as functional units. Urine formation involves three steps: ultrafiltration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. Ultrafiltration produces around 180 liters of filtrate per day but the urine produced is only 1.5 liters. This means that around 99% of filtrate is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Counter current mechanisms and hormones like ADH plays an important role in this process. ADH is an antidiuretic hormone that acts on DCT and bring about reabsorption of water and thus amount of water loss through urine is reduced.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b5c4bf8e454bdf9d87", "616025b625f0a602af9671e7", "64eb06ef3118f713ecfef261", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d1", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b69a1", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda6c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
