Each nephron consists of a glomerulus and the renal tubule. Renal tubule consists of Bowman's capsule and PCT, DCT and Henle's loop. Based on the length of the loop of Henle, two types of nephrons are seen, cortical and juxta-medullary nephrons. Cortical nephrons have a short loop of Henle as it extends in the cortex only and the majority of nephrons are of this type. This type of nephron is mainly responsible for excretion function. Juxta medullary nephrons have a long loop and extend in the medulla. This is primarily responsible for the concentration of urine so that water loss is prevented.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b5c4bf8e454bdf9d87", "616025b625f0a602af9671e7", "64eb06ef3118f713ecfef261", "66d58544a75f05ee8564f5d1", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b69a1", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda6c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
