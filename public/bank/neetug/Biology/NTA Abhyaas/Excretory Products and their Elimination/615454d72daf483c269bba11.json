The Henle\u2019s loop and vasa recta play a significant role in this. The flow of filtrate in the two limbs of Henle\u2019s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a counter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta is&nbsp;also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle\u2019s loop and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining an increasing osmolarity.&nbsp;transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement of Henle\u2019s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism.
