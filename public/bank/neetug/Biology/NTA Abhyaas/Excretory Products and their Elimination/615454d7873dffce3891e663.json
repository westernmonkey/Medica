The flow of filtrate in the two limbs of Henle's loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a counter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta is also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle's loop and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e., from 300 mOsmol/L in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmol/L in the inner medulla.
