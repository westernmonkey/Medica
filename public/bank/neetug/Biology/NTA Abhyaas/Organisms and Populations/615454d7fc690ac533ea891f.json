It can also cause permanent damage to the eyes by destroying the retinal cells. UV rays have been found to cause mutational changes in the immune cells and reducing the immune system.<br /><br />In our country, every year, the tiger census is carried out based on their pug marks and fecal pellets of the tigers to determine the number of tigers in our country.<br /><br />Some desert plants like <em>Opunti</em>a have adapted to survive in the extreme conditions by modifying their leaves to spine that reduces transpiration. Also, the stem is modified in thick flattened green structure that can perform photosynthesis.<br /><br />Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them. During the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host\u2019s egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host bird detecting the foreign eggs and ejecting them from the nest.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
