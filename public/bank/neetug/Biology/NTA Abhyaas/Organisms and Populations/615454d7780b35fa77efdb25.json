While they do not rule out the occurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism is \u2018resource partitioning\u2019. If two species compete for the same resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times for feeding or different foraging patterns.
