Predation can be considered as a natural way of energy transfer between organisms in the trophic level. Predators are found to support species diversity by reducing competition among preys that are competing for resources. Predators have an important role in the ecosystem and their absence can have a detrimental effect. Example, in the American Pacific coast, Pisaster, a starfish is an important predator. On its removal from the ecosystem caused extinction of more than 10 species of invertebrates.<br /><br />Nearly 25 percent of all insects are known to be phytophagous (feeding on plant sap and other parts of plants).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
