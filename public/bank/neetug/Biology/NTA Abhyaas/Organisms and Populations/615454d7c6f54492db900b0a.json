Also, physiological functions, morphology and the geographical distribution of organisms is affected by temperature. Temperature decreases progressively from the equator towards the poles and from plains to the mountain tops. Mango requires higher temperature for tis growth and development and lower temperatures through enzymes, if influences basal metabolism, activity and other physiological functions of the organism. Thus, Mango trees do not and cannot grow in temperate countries like Canada and Germany. All living organisms have several characteristics like growth, reproduction, sensitivity, nutrition, movement, respiration, excretion. Diversity is considered an important characteristic of living organisms as it provides information on its origin and inter-relationship with other organisms and environment.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
