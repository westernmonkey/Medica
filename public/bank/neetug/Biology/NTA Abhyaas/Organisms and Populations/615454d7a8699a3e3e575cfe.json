This region receives the most amount of solar energy which leads to better productivity and higher species diversity. Also, the seasonal variations in such regions are low and the environment mainly remains the same supporting high species richness and promoting niche specialization. Species-area relationships show a rectangular hyperbolic function.<br /><br />Temperate regions include the subtropics and polar circles.
