This is the reason why predators in nature are \u2018prudent\u2019. Prey species have evolved various defenses to lessen the impact of predation.&nbsp;Predators also help in maintaining species diversity in a community, by reducing the intensity of competition among competing prey species.&nbsp;Besides acting as \u2018conduits\u2019 for energy transfer across trophic levels, predators play other important roles.
