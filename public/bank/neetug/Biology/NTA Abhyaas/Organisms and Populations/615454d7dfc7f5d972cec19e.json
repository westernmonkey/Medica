There are four phases of growth curve-<br/><br/>Lag phase - initial phase of growth where population is adapting to the environment and resources are plenty.<br/><br/>Exponential phase - rapid increase in population size where birth rate is higher than death rate. Natality is higher and mortality is low as there is abundance of resources and reduced resistance from environment.<br/><br/>Transitional phase - Due to limited resources competition between organisms of population, the natality starts reducing and increasing mortality.<br/><br/>Plateau phase - the natality is nearly equal to the mortality and population growth becomes static.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
