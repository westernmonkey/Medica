This region receives the most amount of solar energy which leads to better productivity and higher species diversity. Also, the seasonal variations in such regions are low and the environment mainly remains the same supporting high species richness and promoting niche specialization. Although, the soil of the tropical forest is low in nutrients and the majority of the nutrients are stored in the vegetation and trees. Due to the warm climatic condition of the region, dead organisms are decomposed quickly providing nutrients to the plants.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
