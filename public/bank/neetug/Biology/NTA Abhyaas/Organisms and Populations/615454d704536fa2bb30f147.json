The loamy soil has high field capacity of 25-40% and it has more amount of capillary water. The gravitational water is the percolated water through the soil and runaway water is the water that flows after a rainfall. Capillary water is present inside the micropores of soil and is the water that is available to plant roots.The good soil is that which allows percolating the water slowly from it. This makes the water holding capacity to become higher. The capillary water in the soil gets increased and the water available for the plant growth will be higher.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
