Temperature is the most relevant ecologically environmental factor. It ranges from subzero levels in polar areas and high altitudes to &gt;50\u00b0C in tropical deserts in summer.<br />\rB. A few organisms can tolerate and thrive in a wide range of temperatures, they are called eurythermal.<br />\rC.
