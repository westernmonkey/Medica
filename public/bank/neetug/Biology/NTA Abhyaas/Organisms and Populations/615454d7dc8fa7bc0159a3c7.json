The population has a very high proportion of pre-reproductive individuals, proportionate numbers of reproductive individuals are moderate and post-reproductive individuals are proportionately fewer. Because of the very large number of pre-reproductive individuals, more and more of them enter the reproductive phase and rapidly increases the size of the population.<br /><strong>(b)&nbsp;BELL-SHAPED:</strong> &nbsp;The pyramid is bell-like with pre-reproductive individuals being only marginally more than the reproductive individuals. The population is said to be mature or stable as there is no increase or decrease in its size due to growth rate being almost zero.<br /><strong>(c)&nbsp;URN-SHAPED:</strong> It has a small number of pre-reproductive individuals followed by a large number of reproductive individuals. As there are fewer individuals in the pre-reproductive group, the population size will decline with time.
