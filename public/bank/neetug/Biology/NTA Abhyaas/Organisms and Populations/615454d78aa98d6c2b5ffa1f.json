They do so by reducing their metabolic activity and going into a state of \u2018dormancy\u2019. In animals, the organism, if unable to migrate, might avoid the stress by escaping in time. The familiar case of bears going into hibernation during winter is an example of escape in time. Some snails and fish go into aestivation to avoid summer\u2013related problems-heat and dessication.
