The environment should be relatively constant to have more species formation. Temperate regions were subjected to frequent glaciations, are more seasonal and unpredictable. Tropical regions have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long evolutionary time for species diversification. Tropical environments are less seasonal, relatively more constant and predictable. Such constant environments promote niche specialisation and lead to a greater species diversity. There is more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to higher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater diversity.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025efee4edd071604b417", "616025eeb6e1178c0298e542", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef13a", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5f2", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda72"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
