Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as more molecules of oxygen bind to it. Thus, a higher number of molecules bind as the oxygen partial pressure increases until the maximum amount that can be bound is reached. The curve on the right (T) indicates that there is an easy dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin. This occurs when there is a lower affinity between oxygen and haemoglobin. Some conditions which decrease affinity are low partial pressure of oxygen, the high partial pressure of carbon dioxide, low pH, high temperature and high altitudes.<br /><br />In acute mountain syndrome (AMS), the following changes take place in the individual: the number of RBC increases (polycythemia), the affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen decreases, etc.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b912ea6ed5b36c327d", "616025b8661f7863bf136352", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef134", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f613", "67fdff4a378e1624ea7b69b8", "68091fc93a10446a207fdae5"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
