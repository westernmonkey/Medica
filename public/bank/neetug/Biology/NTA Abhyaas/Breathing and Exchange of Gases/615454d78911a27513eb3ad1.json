This is because during exercise the breathing was faster than normal this increases the CO2 concentration in blood. Due to exercise the tissue metabolism also increases and this results in increase in hydrogen ions or decrease in ph also. The muscles require more oxygen and this begins the cori's cycle and thus there is lactic acid concentration seen in the blood also. This sometimes causes cramps too in the muscles. Stimulation of the breathing centre will be least affected as this acts when there is a major change in inspiration and expiration.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b912ea6ed5b36c327d", "616025b8661f7863bf136352", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef134", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f613", "67fdff4a378e1624ea7b69b8", "68091fc93a10446a207fdae5"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
