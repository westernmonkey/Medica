Nervous regulation is done by two centers in the brain. These are the respiratory rhythm center in medulla and pneumotaxic center in the pons. These two centers regulate the rate and depth of breathing. Chemical control is by chemosensitive areas that are sensitive for chemicals and these areas are located adjacent to the rhythm centre. These areas contain chemoreceptors that are sensitive to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. These chemoreceptors are found in aortic bodies (located on aortic arch) and carotid bodies (located in carotid arteries).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025b912ea6ed5b36c327d", "616025b8661f7863bf136352", "64eb06d23118f713ecfef134", "66d5854ba75f05ee8564f613", "67fdff4a378e1624ea7b69b8", "68091fc93a10446a207fdae5"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
