They are known as Darwin's finches, as they were observed by Darwin while he visited the island. He discovered that different varieties of the finches which evolved in the same island. The variety ranged from the original seed-eating features to other forms with altered beaks. These modifications enabled them to become insectivorous and vegetarian finches. This process of evolution of species in a given geographical area which starts at a particular point and radiates to other areas of geography is called adaptive radiation.<br />Another example is Australian marsupials. A number of marsupials, each different from the other evolved from an ancestral stock, but all within the Australian island continent. When more than one adaptive radiation appeared to have occurred in an isolated geographical area (representing&nbsp;different habitats), one can call this convergent evolution. Placental mammals in Australia also exhibit adaptive radiation in evolving into varieties of such placental mammals each of which appears to be \u2018similar\u2019 to a corresponding marsupial (e.g., Placental wolf and Tasmanian wolf-marsupial).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
