It was seen in England that moth (Biston betularia) were available in two varieties. Black and White in colour. In earlier times the white moth were able to survive as these used to camouflage on the barks while black moth were spotted easily. In 1950 industrilisation began in England. This resulted in release of soot and this was deposited on the barks of trees. Thus the barks of trees became black and thus black or dark moths were favoured and survived white white moths were easily spotted by predators. These black moths are also known as melanic moths.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
