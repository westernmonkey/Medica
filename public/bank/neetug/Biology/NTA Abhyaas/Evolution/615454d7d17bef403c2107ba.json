Originally rare in the population of normally light-coloured moths, the frequency of the melanic form increased in polluted areas until it was over 90%. This change in colour has come to be known as 'Industrial melanism'.<br />Before industrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen covered the trees; in that background, the white-winged moth survived but the dark-coloured moth was picked out by predators. Post-industrialization, the tree trunks became covered in soot and turned black. This allowed the dark coloured moth to camouflage themselves, whereas their light coloured forms were easily hunted.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
