We also learnt that under these conditions frequencies of genotypes reach an equilibrium after a single generation of random mating. The conditions include absence of&nbsp;<strong data-iceapw=\"3\">mutations, selection,</strong> <strong>migration</strong>&nbsp;and.<strong data-iceapw=\"2\">random drift.</strong>&nbsp;These conditions are never fulfilled. Therefore, in a large&nbsp;<strong data-iceapw=\"3\">panmictic (random mating)</strong>&nbsp;population, changes in gene frequencies do occur. This change can either be directional as in the case of mutation, selection or migration, or can be nondirectional as in the cases of random drift. The directional change means a change of gene frequencies progressively from one value to another in either direction. If this change is not checked, the forces may lead to eventual fixation of one allele, all other alleles being eliminated. Similarly, the non-directional change means changes which can not be predicted from one generation to the other. The changes in gene frequencies due to different individual factors will be discussed separately.<br /><br />Migration refers to the movement of individuals into and out of population. Mutation refers to random and sudden heritable variations or changes arising in the genetic constitution.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
