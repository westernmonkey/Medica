By interpreting these similarities, one can understand whether common ancestors were shared or not. The sting of honey bee and scorpion are structurally different but functionally similar. Similarly, the wing of an insect and bat are structurally different but perform the same function of flying and also Stipules of Lathyrus and petiole of Acacia are structurally different but functionally similar. Organs that are structurally different but similar in function are analogous organs. As opposed to organs that are structurally similar but different in function are called homologous organs. The forelimbs of frog and humans are structurally the same but perform different functions hence they are homologous organs.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
