They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees. <em>Ramapithecus</em> was more man-like while <em>Dryopithecus</em> was more ape-like. Two mya,&nbsp;<em>Australopithecines</em> probably lived in East African grasslands. Evidence shows they hunted with stone weapons but essentially ate the fruit. Some of the bones among the bones discovered were different. This creature was called the first human-like being the hominid and was called <em>Homo habilis.&nbsp;</em>The brain capacities were between 650-800cc. They probably did not eat meat. Fossils discovered in Java in 1891 revealed the next stage, i.e., <em>Homo erectus</em> about 1.5 mya. <em>Homo erectus</em> had a large brain around 900cc.&nbsp;<em>Homo erectus&nbsp;</em>probably ate meat. The Neanderthal man with a brain size of 1400cc lived in the near east and central Asia between 1,00,000-40,000 years back. They used hides to protect their body and buried their dead. <em>Homo sapiens</em> arose in Africa and moved across continents and developed into distinct races. During ice age between 75,000-10,000 years ago, modern <em>Homo sapiens</em> arose.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
