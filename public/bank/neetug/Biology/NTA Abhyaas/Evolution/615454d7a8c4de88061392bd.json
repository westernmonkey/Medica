According to this theory, evolution is based upon the use and disuse of organs. He said that organs with maximum use increases in size but without use decreased in size. He explained the giraffe example according to this theory. He said that these characters are then inherited from one generation to the next. Weismann wanted to test this theory. He performed an experiment on mice. He cut the tails of mice generation after generation but saw that this feature was not inherited. Thus, he said that Lamarck's theory on inheritance was wrong.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
