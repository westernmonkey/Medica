There he found an amazing range of creatures existing. He found that there were many varieties of small blackbirds in these islands which differed mainly in the shape of beaks and feeding habits. These varieties of small blackbirds were later called Darwin\u2019s Finches. After analyzing them, he realized that all of these varieties evolved on the same island itself and were not from separate areas. He conjectured that these varieties evolved from the original seed-eating ancestor bird which was present in South America. Some of them flew to these islands and according to the needs of different environments, they developed different shapes of beaks and feeding habits. Some became insect-eating, some fruit-eating, some cactus eating, etc.<br />", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
