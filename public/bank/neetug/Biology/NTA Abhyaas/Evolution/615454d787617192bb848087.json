The classic example is industrial melanism. Before industrial melanism white moth was favored over black or melanized moth by nature but after industrialization due to black soot on the branches the black moth survived well. This shows due to natural selection one type was favored over the other. Such natural selection can be of three types: balancing or stabilizing, disruptive and directional. When more individuals of a population acquire a mean character value, it is called a stabilized population. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium explains that if there is no change in the frequency of alleles there will be no evolution taking place. But many factors like genetic drift, migration intervenes with the changes in allelic frequency and thus H-W equilibrium is disturbed.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
