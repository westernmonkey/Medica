Several species belonging to the genus <em>Homo </em>can be recognized from the fossil record. For example, <em>Homo habilis</em> lived in Africa, about two million years ago and was characterized by having a larger brain than <em>Australopithecus,</em> used tools, and was bipedal. Another species, <em>Homo erectus</em> appeared about 1.7 million years ago, used fire, and is believed to have migrated to Asia and Europe. Fossils of the so-called 'Java man' and 'Peking man', belong to <em>Homo erectus. Homo erectus</em> was replaced by Homo sapiens. <em>Homo erectus</em> appears to have survived for another 250,000 years when it was finally replaced by <em>Homo sapiens</em> migrating from Africa.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
