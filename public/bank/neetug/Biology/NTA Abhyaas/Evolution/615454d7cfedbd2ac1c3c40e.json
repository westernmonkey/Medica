The collection is done in the 1850s (before industrialization sets in): On trees, white-winged moths were more in number than dark-winged (or melanized) moths. Before industrialization, white-colored lichen grows and almost covered the trees because of which white-winged moth survived due to white background the but the dark-colored moth was more spotted and picked up by the predators.<br /><br />B. The collection is done in the 1920s (After Industrialization): On trees, Dark -winged moths were more than white-winged moths. Lichens do not grow in polluted areas, so the dark moths were able to camouflage (hide in the background) themselves against the tree trunks became dark due to industrial smoke and soots. Thus they survived in more numbers. White-winged moths were more spotted and picked up by the predators in comparison to the dark-winged.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
