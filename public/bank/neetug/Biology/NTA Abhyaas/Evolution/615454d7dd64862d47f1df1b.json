Regressive or degenerative evolution is development of simpler forms from more complex ones. Such evolution has occurred in case of vestigial organs, parasitic forms, and in the reduction of over specialized structures such as wings in flightless birds. Parallel evolution is the formation of similar trains in related groups of organisms independently due to similar requirement e.g. running of two toed deer and one toed Horse. The kind of evolution in which two species of different genealogy (a line of descent traced continuously from an ancestor) come to resemble one another closely is termed as convergent evolution. Evolution of wings in insects and birds serve as example of convergent evolution&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
