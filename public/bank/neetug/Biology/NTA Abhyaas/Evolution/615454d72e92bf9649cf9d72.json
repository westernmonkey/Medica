Hydrogen was most reactive and thus reacted with nitrogen to form ammonia, with carbon to form methane and with oxygen to form water. Thus these three are most important substances formed in the beginning. Due to high heat from sun water was in vapour form. These three substances constantly reacted with each other in the presence of sunlight and thus resulted in formation of various micromolecules. The first substance formed was amino acids. These together formed proteins. Due to UV rays there were many nucleotides formed which resulted in the formation of nucleic acids (RNA) and these acted as protobionts for formation of first cell. The first genetic material was RNA, from which DNA developed.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
