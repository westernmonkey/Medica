In this, it was seen that the white moths survived before industralisation but after industrialisation this survival was seen among dark coloured moths. This example did not explain any acquired characters explained by Lamarck. In caves due to absence of light , the animals lack pigments. Snakes show presence of rudimentary pelvic girdle and also traces of hind limbs. Aquatic birds show presence of webbed toes. All these examples explain phenomenon of acquired characters that was explained by Lamarckism.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
