Hence, the giraffe has a long neck due to the regular use of stretching the neck to reach the leaves at the top part of the plant/tree. This theory was rejected by August Weismann where he experimented by cutting the tails of mice at each new generation. But found that, every new generation formed from the tail-less acquired parent had a tail in them. Weisman developed the theory of inheritance where the germ-plasm remained intact without change from the main body and that is passed to the next generation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
