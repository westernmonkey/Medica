He theorized that life on Earth originated gradually from chemical evolution of carbon-based molecules in a 'primordial soup'. In simpler terms, life originated from non-living things via gradual reactions and increasing complexity resulting in formation of cell membranes and cell.<br /><br />Origin of Species by natural selection was written by Charles Darwin who gave the theory of evolution and Philosophiezoologique was written by Lamarck who gave theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics.
