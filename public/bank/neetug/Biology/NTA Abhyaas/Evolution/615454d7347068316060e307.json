This is also true for microbes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against eukaryotic organisms/cells. Hence, resistant organisms/cells are appearing at a time scale of months or years and not centuries. These are examples of evolution by anthropogenic action. It is a stochastic process based on chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms. The geological history of earth strongly correlated with the biological history of the earth (The geologic time scale divides up the history of the earth based on life forms that have existed during specific times since the creation of the planet).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
