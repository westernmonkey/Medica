Gene migration or gene flow - When a section of a population migrates to another place and set up new population, then gene frequencies of original as well as the new population changes. New genes/alleles are added to the new population while some genes/alleles are lost from the old population. If the above-mentioned&nbsp;gene migration happens multiple times, it leads to gene flow.<br /><br />2. Genetic drift - If the change in gene frequency occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift.<br /><br />3. Mutation - Experiments on microbes show that pre-existing advantageous mutations help the organisms to get selected and the result is observed in new phenotypes. This may lead to speciation over a few generations.<br /><br />4. Genetic recombination - These occur during gametogenesis.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Natural selection - In this process, heritable variations help the organism for better survival and enable it to reproduce and leave more number of progeny.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025d5df15dcb57fd5eea7", "616025d6759af6d71d4cb3f5", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef13d", "66d58549a75f05ee8564f603", "67fdff3a378e1624ea7b690a", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
