Peptic cells or chief cells that secrete inactive pepsinogen, Oxyntic cells or Parietal cells that secrete HCl and intrinsic factor, Mucous cells that secrete mucus are different groups of cells. Digestion of carbohydrates begin in the mouth. 30% starch is digested and converted into maltose by salivary amylase enzyme. Absorption of digested food takes place through intestine. Absorprion of fatty acids and glycerol do not directly enter the blood stream and these are insoluble in water. These first enter the lacteals and then the blood stream. When these are getting absorbed from intestinal lumen, into mucosa layer micelle formation takes place. Later fat globules Chylomicrons help them to get absorbed from mucosa into the lacteals. Fructose are amino acids are directly absorbed with the help of carrier ions  <math><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">N</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow></msup></math>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025aa989aba1b9b7c3874", "616025abea75411317dff9b3", "64eb06d83118f713ecfef17f", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5ef", "67fdff60378e1624ea7b6ac9", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaaa"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
