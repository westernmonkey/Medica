In iron deficiency anemia the size of erythrocytes will be smaller than the normal since hemoglobin is not formed.

Immature RBCs are larger than mature RBCs. Also, deficiency of vitamin B-12 is commonly found in vegetarians as most of the dietary sources of this vitamin are animal products.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025aa989aba1b9b7c3874", "616025abea75411317dff9b3", "64eb06d83118f713ecfef17f", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5ef", "67fdff60378e1624ea7b6ac9", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaaa"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
