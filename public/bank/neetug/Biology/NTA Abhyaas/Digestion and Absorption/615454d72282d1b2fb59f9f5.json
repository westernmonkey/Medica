Ducts of these glands finally open into the duodenum. These ducts unite at various levels. The liver consists of right and left lobes through which righ and left hepatic ducts arise. These ducts collect bile formed by hepatic cells and unite and form a hepatic duct that further unites with the cystic duct of gall bladder. This is known as the common bile duct. This duct contains concentrated bile from gall bladder and dilute bile from liver. The common bile duct is also known as duct choledochus (chole means bile). This duct then unites with the duct of Wirsung (pancreatic duct) to form the hepatopancreatic duct that opens into the duodenum.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025aa989aba1b9b7c3874", "616025abea75411317dff9b3", "64eb06d83118f713ecfef17f", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5ef", "67fdff60378e1624ea7b6ac9", "68091fc33a10446a207fdaaa"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
