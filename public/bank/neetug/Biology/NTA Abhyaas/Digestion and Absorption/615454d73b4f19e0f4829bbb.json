The d</span>eficiency causes beriberi. Symptoms of this disease of the nervous system include weight loss, emotional disturbances, Wernicke's encephalopathy (impaired sensory perception), weakness and pain in the limbs, periods of irregular heartbeat, and edema (swelling of bodily tissues).<br /><br />Vitamin B3<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>is also called&nbsp;niacin. The<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> d</span>eficiency, along with a deficiency of tryptophan causes pellagra. Symptoms include aggression, dermatitis, insomnia, weakness, mental confusion, and diarrhea. In advanced cases, pellagra may lead to dementia and death.<br /><br />Vitamin C also called as ascorbic acid. The deficiency leads to&nbsp;a condition called scurvy and it is characterised by general weakness, anaemia, gingivitis (gum disease), and skin hemorrhages.<br /><br />Vitamin B12<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> is also known as </span>cobalamin. The<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> d</span>eficiency results in macrocytic anemia, elevated homocysteine, peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, and other cognitive deficits. It is most likely to occur among elderly people, as absorption through the gut declines with age; the autoimmune disease pernicious anemia is another common cause. It can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis.
