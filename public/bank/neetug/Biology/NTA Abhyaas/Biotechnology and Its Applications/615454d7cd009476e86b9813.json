Patients suffering from SCID bear non-functional T- and B-lymphocytes. In many cases, the patients fail to mount an immune response against attacking pathogens. The ideal approach for SCID treatment is to provide functional ADA&nbsp;(enzyme replacement therapy), in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection.<br /><br />The first step towards gene therapy is the lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside the body. A functional ADA cDNA is transfected by using a retroviral vector into these lymphocytes and these cells are subsequently re-inserted back to the patient.&nbsp;", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
