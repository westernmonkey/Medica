ADA is produced by the immune system cells called lymphocytes. The deficiency of ADA is caused by deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase (Severe Combine Immuno Deficiency). The deficiency of ADA can be cured by bone marrow transplantation and in some it can be treated with the help of enzyme replacement therapy in which injections of functional ADA are given to the patient. Both these methods are not completely curative. Permanent cure can be achieved if gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
