For example, in case of large scale protein production, continuous culture is employed with stringent sterile control environment. In continuous culture, medium is continuously fed in the fermenter and product is extracted continuously with regular interval of time. It gives constant product quality and low cost of production than batch culture or fed batch culture in which product quality varies considerably with each batch and cost of production unnecessarily increases.</div>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
