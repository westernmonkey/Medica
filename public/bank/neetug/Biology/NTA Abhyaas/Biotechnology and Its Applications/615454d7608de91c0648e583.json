Initially, insulin was isolated from cattle but that resulted in allergic reactions in patients. Thus, there was a need to produce human insulin. Biotechnology made it possible to produce artificial insulin from humans and this was named as Humulin. The proinsulin i.e. inactive insulin consists of three polypeptide chains A, B and C. But active insulin consists of only A and B polypeptides. A polypeptide consists of 63 nucleotides while B consists of 90 nucleotides.&nbsp;A-chain is formed of 21 amino acid residue, while B-chain is formed of 30 amino acid residue.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
