Mature insulin has two peptide chains - chain A and chain B joined by disulfide bonds. The mature insulin is primarily produced as inactive pro-insulin having a chain C between chain A and B. Chain C is removed for activation of the hormone. Genetic engineering process faced the challenge in developing mature insulin and it was overcome by isolating the gene for chain A and chain B and then producing it in the host bacterial cell. Eli Lily, a pharmaceutical company, prepared two separate DNA sequences each making one protein - chain A and chain B which was then produced individually in different host cell. The extracted chains were later combined by creating disulfide bonds giving the mature human insulin.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
