Gene therapy is a biotechnological technique allowing modification of defective gene that has been diagnosed in the diseased individual. Altering the defective gene is done by delivering the normal gene into the individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate for the non-functional gene. The first gene therapy treatment was given to a girl child who was suffering from SCID where the individual lacked the enzyme ADA or adenosine deaminase. It is an important enzyme for the immunity of the individual. Its deficiency can lead to severe compromise of the immune system. In this process, using a retroviral vector a functional cDNA having the code for ADA is introduced in to the lymphocyte cells which is then returned back to the patient. Since these cells are not immortal, the patient will need regular infusion of modified lymphocytes", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
