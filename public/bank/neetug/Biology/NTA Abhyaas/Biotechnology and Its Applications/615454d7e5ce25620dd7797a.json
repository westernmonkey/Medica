A disease affecting the cotton plant known as cotton bollworms has been eliminated with the help of biotechnology. Bt toxin gene isolated from <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> and incorporated into the cotton plants. Specific gene code for specific toxins. The cry IAc and cryIIAb are useful in the control of cotton bollworm. Another example of the use of biotechnology in agriculture is the development of pest-resistant plants. RNA interference technique was used to overcome the nematode <em>Meloidogyne incognitia</em> which infects and reduces the yield of tobacco plants. The first transgenic cow produced was named Rosie and it produced milk which was rich in human proteins. Elli Lilly is an American company that produced genetically engineered insulin.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025e3fe26a548c6c9606c", "616025e54ddacada7c93590b", "64eb06da3118f713ecfef190", "66d58561a75f05ee8564f6eb", "67fdff58378e1624ea7b6a7c", "68091fc23a10446a207fda9f"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
