This process involves hierarchy of steps where each taxa represents a rank. All the steps/taxon collectively is referred as taxonomic hierarchy.<br /><br />Species is the basic unit of classification and consist of similar individuals that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.<br /><br />Group of related species which has more characters in common in comparison to species of other genera is referred to as genus.<br /><br />Order is a rank in classification that is higher than family but lower than class.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257531d5b34759c487a0", "61602575187508697aeef5d5", "64eb06f13118f713ecfef271", "66d58589a75f05ee8564f85d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
