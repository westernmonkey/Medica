There is a hierarchy in this classification and each step represents a rank or category known as a taxonomic category. There are around seven main taxonomic ranks or categories - species, genus, family, order, class, phylum/division, and kingdom. Groups of individuals having similar fundamental qualities are called species. Species contain a group of interacting and interbreeding organisms. When the group of related species has more common characters among them they are referred to as genus. Families that exhibit few similar characters are placed under the same Order. All the fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along with mammals constitute the taxonomic level phylum.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257531d5b34759c487a0", "61602575187508697aeef5d5", "64eb06f13118f713ecfef271", "66d58589a75f05ee8564f85d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
