This process involves hierarchy of steps where each taxa represents a rank. All the steps/taxon collectively is referred as taxonomic hierarchy. The ranks/taxa have the following sequence from largest to the smallest with similarities in organisms increasing at each step. Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species form the hierarchy in classification where Kingdom is the largest rank and species is the lowest with maximum similarities.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160257531d5b34759c487a0", "61602575187508697aeef5d5", "64eb06f13118f713ecfef271", "66d58589a75f05ee8564f85d"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
