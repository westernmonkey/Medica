Growth is permanent and irreversible change in size, shape, volume and dry weight. Growth can be intrinsic and extrinsic. Non-living also grow but their growth is extrinsic (surface growth due to deposition of substances) whereas living organisms exhibit intrinsic growth (internal growth), intrinsic growth results due to metabolic activity. Plants show Indeterminate growth i.e. grow throughout the life while animals grow only up to certain age.
