Some spermatogonia (termed as primary spermatocytes) periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte completes meiosis-I (reduction division) and gives rise to 2 equal-sized cells called secondary spermatocytes (n = 23). Both secondary spermatocytes undergo meiosis-II (equational division) to produce 2 equal spermatids (n) each.<br /><br />D. Primary follicles are converted to secondary follicles by getting surrounded by a few more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca. Following changes occur in the secondary follicle after which it is immediately converted to tertiary follicle:<br /><br />I. Development of a fluid-filled cavity called antrum.<br /><br />II. Differentiation of Theca layer into theca interna (inner) and theca externa (outer).<br /><br />III. Primary oocyte grows in size, completes meiosis-I (unequal division) resulting in the formation of a large haploid secondary oocyte and a small first polar body. Tertiary follicle changes into the mature follicle (Graafian follicle).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
