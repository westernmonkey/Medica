These oogonia (2n) undergo division and lead to the formation of primary oocytes (2n). A layer of granulosa cells surrounds these oocytes, which leads to the formation of primary follicles. More and more layer of granulosa cells and a new theca surround these primary follicles which leads to the formation of secondary follicles A fluid filled cavity called antrum develops which leads to the formation of tertiary follicle. An unequal division of the primary oocyte in the tertiary follicle leads to the formation of a haploid secondary oocyte i.e. ovum and a tiny first polar body. The largets follicle formed is Graafian follicle. The ovum is released from the Graafian follicle in the secondary oocyte stage", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
