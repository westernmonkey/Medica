The division of the zygote known as cleavage begins in the isthmus of the fallopian tube and the zygote moves towards the uterus while the division continues forming 2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres. The zygote with 8-16 cells is called a morula. During cleavage the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is same but the amount of cytoplasm is reduced. Hence it is not identical to mitosis", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
