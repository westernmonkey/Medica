Menstrual phase (3\u20135 days): Breakdown of the endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels occurs that comes out of the vagina as menstrual fluid.<br /><br />II. Follicular phase: Primary follicles grow to become Graafian follicles. Regeneration of lost endometrium starts with hormonal changes, and a gradual increase in the release of gonadotropins like LH and FSH takes place, which stimulates the follicular development and estrogen release by the growing follicles.<br /><br />III. Ovulatory phase (14th day): LH surge occurs with a peak concentration of LH during the mid-cycle, that ruptures the Graafian follicle and releases an ovum (ovulation).<br /><br />IV. Luteal phase (next 14 days): The remnants of the Graafian follicle are transformed into the corpus luteum that secretes large amounts of progesterone to maintain the endometrium (necessary for implantation of the fertilized ovum).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
