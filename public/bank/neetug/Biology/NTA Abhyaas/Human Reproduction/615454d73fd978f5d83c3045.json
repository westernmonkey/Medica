Both begins with primary mother cells in the gonads. Primary oocyte undergoes meiosis 1 and forms secondary oocyte and first polar body while Primary spermatocyte undergoes meiosis1 and forms two secondary spermatocyte. The process is the same in both but the daughter cells formed are different. In oogenesis, the daughter cells are of unequal size i.e. secondary oocyte is larger than the first polar body because secondary oocyte has maximum amount of cytoplasm retained in it. This unequal division is important because incase sperms approach these gametes, there is a chance of fertilization and zygote formation. Hence cytoplasm can act as stored food for the zygote. While in spermatogenesis the daughter cells formed are of same size as seen in Meiosis of other cells. This is the main difference.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
