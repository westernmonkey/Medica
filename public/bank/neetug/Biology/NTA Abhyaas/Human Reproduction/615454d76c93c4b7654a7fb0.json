It begins with the menstrual or bleeding phase. This represents the shedding of the endometrium of uterus and unfertilized secondary oocyte. This phase is followed by the follicular phase as follicles start developing in the ovary. At the same time the shedded endometrium starts its preparation and this is termed as proliferative phase. The mid of 28-day cycle shows the ovulatory phase that is Graffian follicle from ovary releases secondary oocyte in the oviduct. This is followed by the formation of a corpus luteum and is known as Luteal phase. The secondary oocyte in the oviduct can undergo fertilization hence the uterus prepares itself to receive the fertilized egg by forming secretory glands i.e. secretory phase is seen. As no fertilization takes place the secondary oocyte now starts travelling towards the uterus to shed along with the endometrium i.e. new menstrual cycle begins.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
