The umbilical cord is a tube that connects the mother and the baby during pregnancy, with three blood vessels-one vein that carries food and oxygen in the maternal body from the placenta to the baby and two arteries that carry waste from the fetus/baby back to the placenta. The primary oocyte is surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells to form primary follicle and large number of these follicles degenerates during from birth to puberty. Hence, at the time of puberty only 60,000-80,000 are left in each ovary.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
