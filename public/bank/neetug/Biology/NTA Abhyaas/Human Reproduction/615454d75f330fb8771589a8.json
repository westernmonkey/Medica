The word 'mesum' means one month. Hence this cycle is repeated every month the average interval being <math><mrow><mrow><mn>28</mn></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow><mn>29</mn></mrow></mrow></math> days. This cycle prepares the uterus every month to receive the fertilized product. But if the zygote doesn't arrive the endometrial lining along with ovum sheds and reforms for the next cycle. This continues every month till menopause is reached . Menopause is stoppage of cycle which is seen at the age of 45-52 years. This marke the end of fertility period in females. During menstrual cycle changes are seen in ovary and uterus simultaneously. This cycle begins with menstrual or bleeding phase which lasts for 3 to 5 days. The mid of the cycle (approximately) shows ovulation i.e. release of ovum from the ovary into the oviduct and here the ovum waits for the sperms to arrive. If sperms arrive fertilization might take place and this zygote will then be implanted in the uterus. If sperms does not arrive the ovum will degenerate and will be out through menstruation. Implantation marks the beginning of pregnancy which means zygote will develop for 9 months inside the uterus (in humans). During this period menstruation is not possible as endometrium shedding will cause embryo to shed too. Thus ovulation also does not take place during entire pregnancy.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
