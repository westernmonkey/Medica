The acrosome contains hyaluronidase and acrosin enzymes which eat up the zona pellucida and allows the haploid nucleus in the sperm to join with the haploid nucleus of the ovum.<br /><br />The outer membrane of the ovum is called Zona pellucida.<br /><br />Egg can only survive for up to 24 hours after it's released while sperm can live in the female reproductive tract for about 3 to 5 days. Meeting of sperm with ovum in this duration can increase the chances of fertilization.<br /><br />In oogenesis, oogonium(2n) undergoes mitosis and develops into a primary oocyte, which will begin the first meiotic division, but then arrest; it will finish this division as it develops in the follicle, giving rise to a haploid secondary oocyte and a smaller polar body.<br /><br />The secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division and then arrests again; and will remain so unless it is fertilized by a sperm; if this occurs, a mature ovum and another polar body is produced.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
