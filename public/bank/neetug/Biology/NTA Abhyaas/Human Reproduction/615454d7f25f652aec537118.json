These are milk producing glands. Each gland is divided into 15-20 lobes which are further divided into many lobules. Each lobule has grapelike clusters of milk secreting glands known as alveoli. Milk from alveoli then enters the tubules and finally into ducts. These are mammary ducts that enlarge near nipples and form ampullae. These are expanded structures as milk is stored here. These unite and form lactiferous ducts that finally open at the nipples. Pigmented area around the nipples is known as Areola and it consists of sebaceous glands. Adipose tissue or fatty tissue is found between the lobes and covers the surface of the gland. The amount of fatty tissue determines the size of the breast.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
