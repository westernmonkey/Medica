The formation of the haploid second polar body occurs just after ovulation within the fallopian tube once the sperm touches the ovum. Permanent cessation of menses is menopause. In pregnancy, menses stops temporarily and is regained after delivery of the child. Blastulation occurs within 4-5 days after fertilization. Fertilization occurs within two days after ovulation. So blastulation occurs within 7 days from ovulation when the uterus is still in the luteal phase", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
