It secretes the hormone progesterone.<br />Gastrulation is the phase of embryonic development during which the cells of blastula move in small masses or as a sheet of cells to attain the final locations. such movement is called morphogenetic movement.<br />Sperms in the female genital tract are made capable of fertilizing the egg by secretions of the female genital tract. These secretions of the female tract remove coating substances deposited on the surface of the sperms particularly those on the acrosome. It exposes the receptor sites on acrosome and leads to sperms activations. This phenomenon is called capacitation.<br />Colostrum is a liquid with high nitrogen content, antibodies and vitamins that is secreted from the mammary glands before and just after giving birth.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
