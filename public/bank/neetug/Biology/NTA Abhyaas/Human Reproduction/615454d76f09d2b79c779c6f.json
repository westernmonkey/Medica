Corona radiata cells are not produced by the ovum. They are produced by the ovary which forms the follicle around the ovum.<br /><br />II. Fertilization is the process of the union of sperm and ovum, which leads to the formation of zygote. This occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The sperm is viable for a period of 24-48 hours and an ovum is viable for a period of 24 hours. Therefore, for fertilization to occur, it is necessary that the sperm and ovum are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region.<br /><br />III. Implantation is the process by which the blastocyst gets embedded in the endometrium. It occurs about 7 days after fertilization.<br /><br />IV. The continuous division of morula leads to the formation of blastocyst. The blastocyst then further moves towards the uterus for implantation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c81d98d204f8cbb063", "616025ca73727af85b7f480a", "64eb06d93118f713ecfef189", "66d58546a75f05ee8564f5e6", "67fdff3c378e1624ea7b6923", "68091fcd3a10446a207fdb15"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
