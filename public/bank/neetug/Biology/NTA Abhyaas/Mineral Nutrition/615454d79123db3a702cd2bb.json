It is a part of catalases, peroxidases, cytochromes etc. and plays a role in the electron transport system in photosynthesis. Manganese is absorbed by the plants when it is in the bivalent form. Manganese participates in the photolysis of water in photosystem II during photosynthesis and thus it helps in the electron transport of water to chlorophyll. Copper is absorbed on the clay particles as divalent cations, from where it can be absorbed by the plants by exchange mechanism. It is constituent of plastocyanin which takes part in electron transport during photosynthetic phosphorylation.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a2bd4440d3cce24d14", "616025a37c36a09053888408", "64eb06d63118f713ecfef166", "66d58550a75f05ee8564f645", "67fdff59378e1624ea7b6a83", "68091fc03a10446a207fda83"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
