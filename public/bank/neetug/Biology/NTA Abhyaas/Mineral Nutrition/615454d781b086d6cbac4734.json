This cultivation of plants by placing the roots in nutrient solution is called hydroponics.<br /><br />Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil. Terrestrial plants may be grown with their roots in the mineral nutrient solution only or in an inert medium, such as perlite or gravel.<br /><br />It can avoid problem of soil borne pathogens. It avoids problem of weeding.
