He observed that all plants are made up of different types of cells that combine to form different types of tissues. Theodore Schwann,&nbsp;&nbsp;a British zoologist,&nbsp;observed that various types of animal cells have a thin outer layer. It is called the plasma membrane today. He also concluded that the cell wall is a unique feature of plants. Later Rudolf Virchow added the concept of 'Omnis cellula-e cellula'.
