On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259730adaa82c6000128", "616025966a1cef9af5528821", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef143", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5ec", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6910", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda7a"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
