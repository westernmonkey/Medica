Internal movements of organelles are governed by actin filaments and other components of the cytoskeleton. These filaments make an area in which organelles such as chloroplasts can move. Internal movement is known as cytoplasmic streaming. External movement of cells is determined by special organelles for locomotion. These could be pseudopodia, cilia and flagella.<br /><br />The cytoskeletal elements are required for the delivery of vesicles to the equatorial region of the cell and provide guidance to the cell plate. Vesicles, originating from the Golgi apparatus, travel along microtubules and fuse in a unique manner at the center of the phragmoplast to give rise to the new plasma membranes of the two daughter cells. The cargo they carry contributes to the cell-plate matrix.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["6160259730adaa82c6000128", "616025966a1cef9af5528821", "64eb06d33118f713ecfef143", "66d58547a75f05ee8564f5ec", "67fdff3b378e1624ea7b6910", "68091fbf3a10446a207fda7a"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
