The upper seven pairs of ribs are attached in front directly to the sternum by hyaline cartilage. These are called true rib. The next three pairs of rib costal cartilage attach indirectly to the sternum. They are termed false ribs. The lower two pair of ribs are free in front they are known as floating ribs.&nbsp;These 12 pairs are attached dorsally to thoracic vertebrae. Ribs also are known as costa are 'C' shaped bones. Ventral attachment of ribs varies. The First 7 pairs are known as true ribs as these are attached ventrally to the sternum.
