The muscles located in the reproductive tract are visceral muscles. The activity of these muscles is not under the voluntary control of the nervous system. Hence, they are also called involuntary muscles. Muscle fibers having less quantity of myoglobin, the oxygen storing pigment are known as White Fibers, as they have a pale and white appearance. These fibers also have fewer number of mitochondria. But, the number of sarcoplasmic reticulum is high.
