Ribs are attached to the vertebral column and sternum. There are 12 pairs of ribs attached to the vertebral column posteriorly to the T1-T12 bone. <br/><br/>The first seven sets of ribs attached to the sternum are referred to as \"true ribs\". They are attached by costal cartilages. The last five sets of ribs are referred to as \"false ribs\" of which three pairs share a common cartilaginous connection to the sternum by articulating with 7th rib with hyaline cartilage and the last two (eleventh and twelfth ribs) are termed floating ribs.  They are attached to the vertebrae only and not to the sternum.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025bcc0d3a32a132244c6", "616025bb78d0fa8a6eecf8b0", "64eb06d13118f713ecfef12d", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5e0", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1e"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
