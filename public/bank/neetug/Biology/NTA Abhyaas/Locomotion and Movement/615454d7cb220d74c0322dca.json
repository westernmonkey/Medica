These muscles have thin and thick filaments known as monofilaments or myofibrils whose functional unit is the sarcomere between the two Z-lines. There is the presence of alternate light and dark band s on the myofibrils. The striated appearance of these muscles is due to the presence of two proteins- actin and myosin. The light band or the Isotropic band has actin in it. In the centre of each light band is a fibre which bisects it, called the Z- line. The thin filaments are found to be attached firmly to this line. The H-zone is the central part of the thick filament.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025bcc0d3a32a132244c6", "616025bb78d0fa8a6eecf8b0", "64eb06d13118f713ecfef12d", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5e0", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1e"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
