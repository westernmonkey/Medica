These are classified as Axial skeleton (80) bones and Appendicular skeleton (126) bones. Appendicular skeleton consists of pectoral and pelvic girdle and bones of limbs. Pectoral girdle consists of Clavicle and Scapula. Clavicle is also known as collar bone. It is the only bone which is in horizontal position. It articulates medially with sternum and laterally with acromian process of scapula. Medial end is rounded and lateral end is flat. Scapula is shoulder blade and it is a large triangular bone that extends from 2nd to 7th ribs. Pelvic bone contains a cavity called as Acetabulaum which articulates femur and forms the hip joint. This cavity is formed by fusion of three parts of cozal bone i.e. Ilium, Ischium and Pubis. Appendicular skeleton of lower limb has a bone known as patella (knee cap) which is a sesamoid bone and forms knee joint.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025bcc0d3a32a132244c6", "616025bb78d0fa8a6eecf8b0", "64eb06d13118f713ecfef12d", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5e0", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1e"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
