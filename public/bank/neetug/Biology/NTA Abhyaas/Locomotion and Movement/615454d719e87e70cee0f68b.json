The muscle contraction is achieved by the sliding of actin filaments over myosin filaments. During muscle contraction, two Z lines come close, the Light band (I band) shortens and the length of dark band (A band) remains the same. H zone or Henson's zone is the area in the middle of the dark band where actin filaments don't overlap myosin filaments in a relaxed muscle fibre. During contraction, the actin filaments completely overlap the myosin filaments and thus there is no H zone.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025bcc0d3a32a132244c6", "616025bb78d0fa8a6eecf8b0", "64eb06d13118f713ecfef12d", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5e0", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1e"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
