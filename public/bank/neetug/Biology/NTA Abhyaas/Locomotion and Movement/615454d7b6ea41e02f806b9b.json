One lower limb also has 30 bones (1 Femur, 1 Tibia, 1 Fibula, 1 patella, 7 tarsals, 5 metatarsals and 14 phalanges). There are 8 bones in the cranium (2 Parietals, 2 Temporals, 1 Frontal, 1 Occipital, 1 Sphenoid and 1 Ethmoid). Wrist bones are carpals. There are 8 carpals in one hand (Scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisci form, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and hamate). The first seven pairs of ribs which are attached to the sternum by their own cartilage are true ribs. Thus there are 14 true ribs. Bones of the fingers are phalanges. Each hand has 14 phalanges (2 in thumb and 3 in each finger). There are 8 cervical vertebrae in the human body. Each ankle has 7 bones (tarsals) but the body has 2 ankles thus number of ankle bones in the body is  <math><mn>14</mn><mo>.</mo></math>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025bcc0d3a32a132244c6", "616025bb78d0fa8a6eecf8b0", "64eb06d13118f713ecfef12d", "66d58545a75f05ee8564f5e0", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a1e"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
