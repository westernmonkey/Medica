On the basis of extent of movement possible at the joints, these are of three types : Immovable joints, slightly movable joints and freely movable joints. Immovable joints are known as fixed or Synarthroses (Syn meaning fusion and arthroses are joints) or fibrous joints as the bone ends are fused by means of fibrous tissue. These joints are seen in cranium in the form of zig-zag structures known as sutures that joint different cranial bones.
