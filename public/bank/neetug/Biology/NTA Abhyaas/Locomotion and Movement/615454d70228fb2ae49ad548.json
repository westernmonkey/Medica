Inbetween two bones are present joints and these are responsible for movement. These joints can be of three types depending of amount of mobility. These can be Fibrous joints that are immovable joints. Example: Sutures in skull, Cartilaginous joints are slightly movable joints, Example: joint between vertebrae and Diarthroses which are freely movable joints. These can be of various types.  <math><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi><mo>)</mo></math>  Pivot joint.
