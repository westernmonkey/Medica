Gibberellins are growth promoters. They were first discovered in a fungus <em>Gibberella fujikuroi</em>. There are many gibberellins and they are denoted as GA1, GA2, GA3 and so on. However, GA3 was one of the first gibberellins to be discovered and remains the most intensively studied form. Spraying juvenile conifers with GAs hastens the maturity period, thus leading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting (internode elongation just prior to flowering) in beet, cabbages and many plants with rosette habit.The hormone which is activated during deficiency of water is absicisic acid, the hormone which is responsible for apical dominance is auxin and the hormone which prevents apical dominance is plants is cytokinin.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
