Their number goes on the increase with time. There is lag, log, and the stationary phase is present in the curve. In this curve, only one daughter cell divides and other daughter cells differentiate and mature. These characters are responsible for the linear curve in arithmetic growth.<br /><br />In geometric growth, the growth is directly proportional to the nutrient supply. If we supply more nutrients then growth will occur. The sigmoid growth curve is also known as the logistic growth curve and it is S shape. In lag phase growth is slow and in the log phase, the growth increases very rapidly and in the last phase it slows down when they reach carrying capacity.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
