Ethylene is a gaseous hormone which helps in the internode elongation or petiole elongation in plants. It is a multifunctional phytohormone which promotes or inhibits the growth and senescence of leaves depending on the plant species. ABA is abscisic acid which is known as an inhibitor and plays an important role in seed development and maturation by inducing the closure of stomata and also involved in seed dormancy.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
