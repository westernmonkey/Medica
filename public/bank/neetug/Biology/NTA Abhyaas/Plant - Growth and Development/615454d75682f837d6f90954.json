Ethylene promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs, especially of leaves and flowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the respiration rate during the ripening of the fruits. This rise in the rate of respiration is called respiratory climactic. Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid internode/petiole elongation in deepwater rice plants. It helps leaves/ upper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase their absorption surface. Ethylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronizing fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
