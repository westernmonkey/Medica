The difference in shapes of leaves produced in air and those produced in water in buttercup also represent the heterophyllous development due to environment. In cotton, coriander and larkspur, the leaves of the juvenile plant are different in shape from those in mature plants. This phenomenon of difference in leaf structure is called heterophylly. The ability of plants to follow different pathways in response to environment or phases of life to form different kinds of structures is called plasticity. Thus heterophylly is an example of plasticity.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
