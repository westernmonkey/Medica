This view is amply supported by an experiment, where if the stem tip is cut off, the axillary buds found below sprout immediately. Instead, if an agar block containing auxin placed over the decapitated stem, the axillary buds remain suppressed. It is clear from the above experiment, that auxin present in the main apex somehow inhibits the growth of the axillary bud. The severity of apical dominance is greater on the axillary buds present nearer to the main apex. Nevertheless, apical dominance exerted by the auxins can be overcome by the application of cytokinin to axillary buds. This is because cytokinin induces cytokinesis", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
