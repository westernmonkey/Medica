In this process, the seed has turned into a plantling and growing to be a plant while been attached to the parent plant or within the fruit itself. It is commonly observed in tomato, mangroves. Such process occurs when the condition for the seed germination is favourable. Annual crop plants are those group that produce for only one growing season. For the next season the seeds of the plant are stored. If such plants slow vivipary then it will be not feasible to store seeds as the seeds have already germinated. They cannot be used for next season.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
