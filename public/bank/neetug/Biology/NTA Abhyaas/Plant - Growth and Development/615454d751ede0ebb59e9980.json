Parthenocarpy is the production of fruit artificially or naturally without fertilization of ovules.<br /><br />Auxin is a plant hormone which when sprayed on the flowers of tomato induces parthenocarpy.<br /><br />Ethephon is a plant growth regulator used for promotion of fruit ripening, abscission and to induce flowering in plants. Ethylene is the gaseous phytohormone responsible to induce flowering in mango plants as it is involved in the growth and senescence of leaves. GA is the gibberellic acid which is mainly involved in plant growth and development and therefore it is used for elongation and improvement in the shape of apple in plants. Cytokinin is a plant hormone primarily used to promote cell division, to overcome apical dominance and they also promote nutrient mobilization in addition to the formation of new leaves and chloroplast.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
