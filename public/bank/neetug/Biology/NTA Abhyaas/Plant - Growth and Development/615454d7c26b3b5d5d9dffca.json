It is a type of promotory hormones. One of the effects of this hormone is the increase in the axis of the stem.<br/><br/>Auxins are one the growth promoters found in plants. These are mostly produces by the apical parts of roots and stems and from there move to different parts of plant as per need. Indole-3-acetic acid(IAA) and indole butyric acid(IBA) are produced by plant and have been isolated as natural auxins. <br/><br/>Cytokinin is a group of plant growth regulator that promotes cell division. Kinetin is a type of cytokinin which is a modified purine discovered in autoclaved herring sperm DNA. These help in leaves production, chloroplast production. These chemicals have an impact on the cytokinesis process.<br/><br/>Abscisic acid was discovered for its role in abscission and dormancy. It stimulates stomata closure and helps tolerate various types of stress. It helps the seed to withstand desiccation and other unfavorable conditions. It is called as the stress hormone.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
