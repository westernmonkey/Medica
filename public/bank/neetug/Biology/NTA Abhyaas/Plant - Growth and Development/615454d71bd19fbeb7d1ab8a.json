(ii) The growth of the given system per unit time expressed on a common basis, e.g., per unit initial parameter, is called the relative growth rate.<br />Here, absolute growth of leaf A to A\u2019 is 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas that of leaf B to B\u2019 is 10cm<sup>2.</sup>&nbsp;Hence, absolute growth is different. Since 2.5 is 25% of 10, there is a total 25% increase in growth in leaf A, and in leaf B, 10 is 25% of 40, so there is also 25% increase in growth. Hence, the relative growth of two leaves is the same, that is 25%.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602599e962f1fddb35be8b", "6160259a99b8dbc5edfb3f73", "64eb06d53118f713ecfef15b", "66d5854fa75f05ee8564f63d", "68091fbe3a10446a207fda76"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
