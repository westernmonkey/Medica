Hence, it is also called Collip's hormone. It is a hypercalcemic hormone. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the adenohypophysis. It helps in the growth of the mammary gland and formation of milk. After childbirth, it also maintains corpus luteum for about three to six months leading to lactation amenorrhoea. Hence, prolactin is also called luteotrophic hormone. Vasopressin (increases blood pressure) is secreted by the hypothalamus but stored and released by neurohypophysis. It also acts on the kidney stimulating it to absorb more water. Hence, it is also called anti-diuretic hormone. The thyroid gland produces two hormones tri-iodothyronine T3 and tetra-iodothyronine T4. Since a major portion of the hormone produced is T4, it is called thyroxine. In the example, note the spelling. It is written tetra-iodotyrosine. It should have been tetra-iodothyroxine.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a79fd0ba00a6729b37", "616025a8d94f353fd75bfbbc", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef171", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fd", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b699e", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda62"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
