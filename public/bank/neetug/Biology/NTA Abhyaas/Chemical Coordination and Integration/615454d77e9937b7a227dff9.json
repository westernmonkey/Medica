It contains many neurosecretory cells which secrete hormones. These hormones control the formation and secretion of pituitary hormones. The pituitary gland is attached to the hypothalamus via stalk known as infundibulum. The pituitary gland is made up of two lobes : Adenohypophysis and Neurohypophysis and both these parts are dependent on the hypothalamus. Hypothalamus secretes various releasing and inhibiting hormones which bring about the release of hormones of anterior pituitary which is a part of Adenohypophysis. An example is growth hormone from the pituitary is released under the influence of growth hormone-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. This is known as somatocrinin. The release is inhibited by growth hormone inhibiting hormone i.e. somatostatin.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a79fd0ba00a6729b37", "616025a8d94f353fd75bfbbc", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef171", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fd", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b699e", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda62"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
