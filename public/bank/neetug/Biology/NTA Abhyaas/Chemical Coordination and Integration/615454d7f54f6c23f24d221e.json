Thyroxine and calcitonin are secreted by the thyroid gland. Thyroxine plays an important role in the regulation of various organs of the body whereas calcitonin plays a major role in blood calcium level regulation. Somatotropin (growth hormone) and prolactin are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Insulin and Glucagon are secreted by the pancreas and play a major role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Somatostatin is also secreted by the pancreas (delta cells of islets of Langerhans) has acted as a regulating hormone that regulates the levels of both insulin and glucagon. It is also secreted by the hypothalamus.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a79fd0ba00a6729b37", "616025a8d94f353fd75bfbbc", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef171", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fd", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b699e", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda62"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
