Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of islets of langerhans that are small clusters of endocrine cells in pancreas and Insulin is released by beta cells of pancreas. Glucagon brings about breakdown of glycogen into glucose and thus increases the level of glucose in blood. Insulin further carries this glucose to different cells and thus reduces blood glucose level. After cellular uptake too if the glucose levels are high in the blood insulin causes mobilization of glucose from blood into hepatocytes and adipocytes where it gets converted into glycogen which is the reserve form.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025a79fd0ba00a6729b37", "616025a8d94f353fd75bfbbc", "64eb06d73118f713ecfef171", "66d58548a75f05ee8564f5fd", "67fdff48378e1624ea7b699e", "68091fbd3a10446a207fda62"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
