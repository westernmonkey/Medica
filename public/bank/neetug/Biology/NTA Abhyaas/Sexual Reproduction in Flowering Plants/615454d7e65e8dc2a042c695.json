If it is between different flower of different plant, then it is called cross pollination. From the given information, since male and female flowers are separate, it will follow cross pollination. The flower is not attractive but has long filament exposing the stamens and stigma is feathery. This suggests the agent of pollination to be wind rather than animal. As there is no mention of mucilage secretion on pollen, it is not water pollinated.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c322cc696a9491eb44", "616025c2822b7bb5e27982e5", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24a", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f626", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a22", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
