Plants use agents to help in the cross pollination process where pollen is transferred to a different flower of different plant. Water is of the agent used by plants. Although it is quite rare in flowering plants to use water as pollinating agent and is limited to 30 genera. Mostly in the monocotyledons.<br /><br />In water pollination, to protect the pollen grain from wetting, a mucilage covering is present. <em>Vallisnera</em>, a fresh water plant, use water as medium for pollination where pollen grains are released on the surface of water and use the water current to reach the stigma. In <em>Zostera</em>, the pollens (long, ribbon-like) are released inside the water and carried to the submerged female stigma.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c322cc696a9491eb44", "616025c2822b7bb5e27982e5", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24a", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f626", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a22", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
