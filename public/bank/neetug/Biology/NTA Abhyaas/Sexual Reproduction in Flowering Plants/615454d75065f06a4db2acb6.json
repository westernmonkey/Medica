Microgametogenesis comprises events that lead to the progressive development of the unicellular microspores into mature microgametophytes containing the gametes. This phase begins with the expansion of the microspore which is commonly associated with the formation of a single large vacuole. Vacuolation is accompanied by the displacement of the microspore nucleus to an eccentric position against the microspore wall. In this position, the nucleus undergoes first pollen mitosis (pollen mitosis I) which results in the formation of two unequal cells, a large vegetative cell and a small generative cell each containing a haploid nucleus.&nbsp;In over 60 percent of angiosperms, pollen grains are shed at this 2-celled stage. In the remaining species, the generative cell divides mitotically to give rise to the two male gametes before pollen grains are shed (3-celled stage).", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c322cc696a9491eb44", "616025c2822b7bb5e27982e5", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24a", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f626", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a22", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
