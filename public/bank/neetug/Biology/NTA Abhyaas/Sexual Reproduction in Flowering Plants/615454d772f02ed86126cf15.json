If fruit develops without fertilization then it is called as parthenocarpic fruit. The fruit basically is formed by maturation of ovary after fertilization. Ovary cells are not involved in fertilization. The genotype of fruit will remain the same as that of the female reproductive organ. The female plant genotype given is BBCC. Thus, the fruit thus obtained will have the same genotype BBCC.<br /><br />The embryo within the seed of the fruit is formed by the fusion of gametic cells. The pollen which is male gamete has genotype -AD and the female gamete has BC as the genotype. Thus, the embryo will have the genotype -AABBCCDD.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c322cc696a9491eb44", "616025c2822b7bb5e27982e5", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24a", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f626", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a22", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
