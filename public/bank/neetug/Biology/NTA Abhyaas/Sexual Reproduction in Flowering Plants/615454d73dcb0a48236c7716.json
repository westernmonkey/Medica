In the coconut fruit, the endosperm which is liquid in its early development undergoes repeated nuclei division before undergoing cytokinesis. The endosperm provides nutrition to the developing embryo.  During early development of liquid endosperm in coconut fruits, nuclei divide repeatedly before cytokinesis sets in. In this, karyokinesis is not followed by cytokinesis. It is commonly called as liquid endosperm. Milky water in coconut is the liquid endosperm present in it. Its function is to provide nourishment for the developing embryo. The liquid endosperm shows syncytial stages.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c322cc696a9491eb44", "616025c2822b7bb5e27982e5", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24a", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f626", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a22", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
