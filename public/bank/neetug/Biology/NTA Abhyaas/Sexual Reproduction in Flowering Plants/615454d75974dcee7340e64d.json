Dicotyledons typically have two cotyledons &amp; monocotyledons&nbsp; have only one cotyledon. The single shield shaped cotyledon in grains is known as scutellum.<br />The scutellum does not contain food &amp; its function is to absorb food from the endosperm &amp; transfer it to the growing parts of the embryo. The plumule consists of growing tip of the shoot along with few young leaf primordia.<br />It is covered by a sheath called coleoptile. The radicle which lies at the base of the grain is also covered with a sheath called coleorhiza.
