Pollen grain has two layers- exine- outer covering made of sporopollelin and intine- inner layer primarily having cellulose and pectins. Pollen grains travel quite a distance in cross pollination process thus, they remain viable for months in many plants. Syngamy is the process of fertilization which is not dependent on the release of two/three celled stage of pollen grain. In the exine of pollen grain there are pores called germ pore which enable the elongation of pollen tube after the pollen reaches the stigma.<br/><br/>In the coconut fruit, the edible part and the liquid form the endosperm which is consumed by the embryo during its growth.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "cpyqbSubjects": ["616057290283de43c87e3e1a", "616057b00283de43c87e3e20", "64d50cd33df7f4a7f3017f71", "66b79bbbd4b564dfab4f94d2", "67fa60d64468eb1307ceb0b0", "6807d392647479b8e869647c"], "cpyqbChapters": ["616025c322cc696a9491eb44", "616025c2822b7bb5e27982e5", "64eb06ed3118f713ecfef24a", "66d5854ca75f05ee8564f626", "67fdff51378e1624ea7b6a22", "68091fbc3a10446a207fda56"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059d70283de43c87e3e24", "616059730283de43c87e3e22"]}, "fetch_status": true}
