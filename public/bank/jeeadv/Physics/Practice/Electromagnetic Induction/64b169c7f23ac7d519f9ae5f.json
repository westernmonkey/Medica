Due to motion of train, current induces in the coil of track which levitate it. This is in accordance with Lenz's law. If trains lower down then due to Lenz's law a repulsive force increases due to which train gets uplifted and if it goes much high then there is a net downward force disc to gravity. The advantage of Maglev train is that there is no friction between the train and the track, thereby reducing power consumption and enabling the train to attain very high speeds.\nDisadvantage of Maglev train is that as it slows down the electromagnetic forces decreases and it becomes difficult to keep it leviated and as it moves forward according to Lenz law, there is an electromagnetic drag force.<strong>Question:</strong>\nWhat is the disadvantage of this system?", "image": null}, "options": [{"id": "dPOKS", "text": "\nTrain experiences upward force according to Lenz's law\n", "image": null, "isCorrect": false}, {"id": "TkZAp", "text": "\nFriction force create a drag on the train\n", "image": null, "isCorrect": false}, {"id": "adzOH", "text": "\nRetardation\n", "image": null, "isCorrect": false}, {"id": "EpRi5", "text": "\nBy Lenz's law train experience a drag", "image": null, "isCorrect": true}], "correctValue": null, "solution": {"text": "No solution is required.", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "masterId": "MOGJAPYQ95132351", "numericalLowerLimit": null, "numericalUpperLimit": null, "bucket": "", "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["61bb58181213731910ea0b70", "61c055eae8ce0dc8a5c62d33", "616057750283de43c87e3e1b", "61964fe0a5a5260118868021", "61964f81a5a526011886801d", "629f39e4ac11b26562e0625b", "616057920283de43c87e3e1e", "615f0c729476412f48314dab", "61a8a2c2e8ce0dc8a5c62d2d", "629105adee9e3ae00d63352b", "629f385f263330a77be9fa7d", "616056cd0283de43c87e3e15", "616057190283de43c87e3e18", "62962075e7f8e9ac4daeafd7", "64d50bd73df7f4a7f3017f6f", "66b79b34d4b564dfab4f94cc", "678ea9a09cc79e5f592bdc11", "67fa5fef4468eb1307ceb0ad", "6807d2ad647479b8e8696479"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61602427cba2fa9ed9e72f82", "61bb82298adb7037e33f5e90", "6160242956b3f4e9b44d7836", "6160242ae6745f9dfbbf4eef", "61964c8f2c567a99ecc74113", "61602429b42b3007928c2021", "61e7bd7f4ea4ca4e8a493885", "6160242803cde39247fbcbae", "61964c8f782d0b7527c95ac9", "61c089b6c9a8a8e3433b1b2d", "6296212226b6eca689110f83", "629f390b0e3e15ddeed9a64e", "629109ebf9b127a2e6449c7b", "629f3a90c4d08c5950ee686b", "64eb06bf3118f713ecfef066", "66d58539a75f05ee8564f55f", "67921d671d5b5072da5e9ac6", "67fdff47378e1624ea7b6991", "6809202e3a10446a207fdf0c"], "cpyqbExams": ["616059150283de43c87e3e21"]}, "fetch_status": true}
