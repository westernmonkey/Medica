Consider, for example, a thin uniform disc welded (rigidly fixed) horizontally at its rim to a massless, stick, as shown in the figure. When the disc-stick system is rotated about the origin on a horizontal frictionless plane with angular speed $\\omega$, the motion at any instant can be taken as a combination of (i) a rotation of the centre of mass of the disc about the $z$-axis and (ii) a rotation\r\n\r\nof the disc through an instantaneous vertical axis passing through its centre of mass (as is seen from the changed orientation of points $P$ and $Q$ ). Both these motions have the same angular speed $\\omega$ in this case\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn-question-pool.getmarks.app/pyq/jee_advanced/k9a0gkqrk76de5TNo7FCtM_RG3uk_Hkg5fwnlMuz3ck.original.fullsize.png\"><br>\r\n\r\nNow consider two similar systems as shown in the figure: Case\r\n\r\n(a) the disc with its face vertical and parallel to $x-z$ plane; Case\r\n\r\n(b) the disc with its face making an angle of\r\n\r\n$45^{\\circ}$ with $x-y$ plane and its horizontal diameter parallel to $x$-axis. In both the cascs, the disc is welded at point $\\mathrm{P}$, and the systems are rotated with constant angular speed $\\omega$ about the $z$ axis.<img src=\"https://cdn-question-pool.getmarks.app/pyq/jee_advanced/T1wfRP1771rg9BSl6YWy11DgkMTVq3us_XJ7HlJYEoE.original.fullsize.png\"><br><strong> Question:</strong> Which of the following statements about the instantaneous axis (passing through the centre of mass) is correct?", "image": null}, "options": [{"id": "wq4HE", "text": "It is vertical for both the cases (a) and (b)", "isCorrect": true, "image": null}, {"id": "hiG38", "text": "It is vertical for case (a); and is at $45^{\\circ}$ to the $x-z$ plane and lies in the plane of the disc for case (b).", "isCorrect": false, "image": null}, {"id": "KD21K", "text": "It is horizontal for case (a); and is at $45^{\\circ}$ to the $x$ - $z$ plane and is normal to the plane of the disc for case (b).", "isCorrect": false, "image": null}, {"id": "0g9UG", "text": "It is vertical for case (a); and is $45^{\\circ}$ to the $x-z$ plane and is normal to the plane of the disc for case (b).", "isCorrect": false, "image": null}], "correctValue": null, "solution": {"text": "Axis of rotation is parallel to z-axis.
