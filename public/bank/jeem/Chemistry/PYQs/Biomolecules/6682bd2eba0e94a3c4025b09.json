RNA (ribonucleic acid) is not typically regarded as the reserve of genetic information in the same way that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is. While RNA does play important roles in gene expression, protein synthesis, and regulation of cellular processes, it is DNA that is traditionally considered the primary repository of genetic information in cells.</p><p>B. DNA molecule self-duplicates during cell division. (True) \u00a0</p><p>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) self-duplicates during cell division through a process called DNA replication. DNA replication is a fundamental process that ensures each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic information from the parent cell.</p><p>C. While DNA contains the genetic instructions necessary for synthesizing proteins, it does not directly synthesize proteins itself. Instead, the process by which proteins are synthesized from the genetic information encoded in DNA involves several steps and intermediates, collectively known as the central dogma of molecular biology.\u00a0</p><p>D. The message for the synthesis of particular proteins is present in DNA. (True) \u00a0</p><p>The message for the synthesis of particular proteins is present in DNA in the form of a specific sequence of nucleotide bases. This sequence is transcribed into mRNA, which carries the genetic information to the ribosomes for translation into a specific sequence of amino acids, ultimately leading to the synthesis of a particular protein.</p><p>E. Identical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. (True)</p><p>Identical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells through the processes of DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cell division. These processes ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete and identical set of genetic information from the parent cell.</p></blockquote>", "image": null}, "videoSolution": null, "bucket": "Must Do Ques (JEE Main) - Any Difficulty", "concepts": [], "masterId": "MOGJMPYQ66789107", "subject": "Chemistry", "subjects": ["615d70bd9948bc1b21da2b1f"], "chapters": ["615d6fef2b295b085ab6ebc7"], "topics": [], "previousYearPapers": [{"_id": "65c4c0c11d30997d3436bb03", "title": "JEE Main 2024 (30 Jan Shift 2)", "isVisible": true}], "numericalLowerLimit": 3, "numericalUpperLimit": 3, "classes": [], "microConcepts": [], "exams": ["615d76b2c52ffa3c944600df"], "isRemoved": false, "cpyqbSubjects": ["615f0cf69476412f48314dac", "616057040283de43c87e3e16", "61bb58281213731910ea0b71", "6160579d0283de43c87e3e1f", "61964f94a5a526011886801e", "61c055f6e8ce0dc8a5c62d34", "61a8a2cce8ce0dc8a5c62d2e", "6160577e0283de43c87e3e1c", "616057210283de43c87e3e19", "629105adee9e3ae00d63352c", "62962075e7f8e9ac4daeafd8", "629f385f263330a77be9fa7e", "629f39e4ac11b26562e0625c", "61964ff3a5a5260118868022", "64d50c263df7f4a7f3017f70", "66b79b89d4b564dfab4f94d0", "678ea9a09cc79e5f592bdc12", "67fa602f4468eb1307ceb0ae", "6807d350647479b8e869647a"], "cpyqbChapters": ["61bb823253ffde591a05d674", "61964d2de9ec95f12f1adba3", "61602593dc8b5d6c99961f7e", "61c089c5520dcac639d46374", "61e7bd83287be10f1f6a68bf", "61602591657b621f6c16e827", "6160259449fa7c74f84e2e16", "61964d2cfbd24229c57ba3bb", "61602593ffb3d20e1b2c9b14", "629109d73a831a2d3b773500", "62962116bd17d3fee183d2c2", "641b35e785076b4f396d25a8", "629f38fd0d23a010addea797", "629f3a83fdd02e41477305ae", "648d9714f3fc9c246caf7de6", "64eb06e83118f713ecfef21e", "66d5856fa75f05ee8564f770", "67921d6f1d5b5072da5e9b0b", "67fdff53378e1624ea7b6a34", "68091fe53a10446a207fdc07"], "cpyqbExams": ["615f0e999476412f48314daf", "616059af0283de43c87e3e23"]}}
